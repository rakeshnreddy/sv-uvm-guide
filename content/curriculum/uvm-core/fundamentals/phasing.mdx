## Level 1: Definition and Analogy

UVM phasing is the **schedule** that orchestrates every component. Like stages of a concert rehearsal, components prepare (`build_phase`), connect instruments (`connect_phase`), perform (`run_phase`), and wrap up (`report_phase`).

## Level 2: In‑Depth Walkthrough

```systemverilog
class my_env extends uvm_env;
  `uvm_component_utils(my_env)
  function void build_phase(uvm_phase phase);
    super.build_phase(phase);
    // create sub components
  endfunction
  task run_phase(uvm_phase phase);
    phase.raise_objection(this);
    // stimulus
    phase.drop_objection(this);
  endtask
endclass
```

## Level 3: Edge‑Case Insights

* Always call `super.build_phase` and friends to ensure parents create children.
* Phases can be jumped with `phase.jump(uvm_reset_phase::get())`, but use sparingly.
* Remember: **"Phasing is the rehearsal schedule"** – keep components in sync.

      "explanation": "The objection mechanism is the standard way to control the duration of a test. The `run_phase` will not end until all raised objections are dropped."
