## Level 1: Definition and Analogy

`uvm_object` and `uvm_component` form the root of every UVM class. Think of `uvm_object` as a **package** that is shipped around, while `uvm_component` is a **building** permanently placed in the testbench city. The base classes exist so that every piece of data or infrastructure in UVM follows common creation and reporting rules.

## Level 2: In‑Depth Walkthrough

The `uvm_component_utils` macro registers a component with the factory so it can be created later. The `build_phase` is where components are typically instantiated.

```systemverilog
class my_driver extends uvm_driver#(my_item);
  `uvm_component_utils(my_driver)
  function new(string name, uvm_component parent);
    super.new(name,parent);
  endfunction
  function void build_phase(uvm_phase phase);
    super.build_phase(phase);
    // create a transaction via the factory
    my_item tr = my_item::type_id::create("tr");
  endfunction
endclass
```

## Level 3: Edge‑Case Insights

* `uvm_component` participates in phasing; forgetting `super.build_phase` can break hierarchies.
* `uvm_object` derived classes should use the `clone` method when copying to preserve factory type.
* Remember: **"Components are buildings, objects are packages"** – a quick mnemonic seasoned engineers repeat.
