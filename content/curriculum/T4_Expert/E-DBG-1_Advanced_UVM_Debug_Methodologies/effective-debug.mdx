## Level 1

Debugging is detective work. Start by narrowing down what changed between a passing and failing run.

## Level 2

- Use `uvm_info` with verbosity levels to toggle detail.
- Add waveform triggers around key events.

## Level 3

Long simulations often mask the real failure. Divide and conquer by reducing randomization or time until the bug reproduces in seconds.
