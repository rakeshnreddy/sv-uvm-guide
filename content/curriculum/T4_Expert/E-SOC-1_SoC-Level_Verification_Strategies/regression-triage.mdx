## Level 1: Overview

A **regression** is a suite of tests run repeatedly (often nightly) to catch new bugs early. **Triage** is the process of analyzing failures to determine root cause.

## Level 2: Best Practices

- Keep a small "smoke" suite for quick checks and a larger nightly run.
- Store logs and seed numbers with each run for easy reproduction.
- <Alert>Automate failure categorization—test issue vs DUT bug—so engineers focus on real problems.</Alert>

<Quiz questions={[{
  question: "What information is most useful when reproducing a failing test?",
  options: ["Random seed", "Editor theme", "User name"],
  correctAnswer: "Random seed"
}]}/>

## Level 3: Anecdote

Veteran teams often rotate "regression sheriff" duty. The sheriff monitors nightly results, files bugs, and ensures fixes are backported before the next run.
