## Quick Take
- **What it is:** An orchestration layer that elevates IP-level assets into full-chip verification with shared scenarios, coverage, and risk tracking.
- **Why it matters:** Integration bugs hide at subsystem boundaries; structured SoC verification finds them before silicon.
- **The Analogy:** Managing a city: buildings (IPs) were inspected alone, but now traffic laws, utilities, and emergency response must work together.

> **Signal:** If every subsystem team writes bespoke stimulus, the SoC plan isn’t reusable enough—unify the flow.

## Build Your Mental Model
### Vertical reuse in action
Reuse agents and checkers from IP benches by flipping them passive; layer system sequencing on top.

<InteractiveCode
  language="systemverilog"
  fileName="soc_reuse.sv"
  code={`class spi_soc_test extends uvm_test;
  `uvm_component_utils(spi_soc_test)
  soc_env m_env;

  function void build_phase(uvm_phase phase);
    super.build_phase(phase);
    uvm_config_db#(uvm_active_passive_enum)::set(
      this, "m_env.spi_env.spi_agent", "is_active", UVM_PASSIVE);
  endfunction

  task run_phase(uvm_phase phase);
    phase.raise_objection(this);
    boot_vseq seq = boot_vseq::type_id::create("seq");
    seq.start(m_env.soc_vsequencer);
    phase.drop_objection(this);
  endtask
endclass`}

### Scenario-driven planning
Map SoC features (boot, DMA bursts, low-power entry) to virtual sequences, formal properties, and emulation runs. Track coverage per feature, not per module.

### Multi-domain coordination
Mix digital, analog, firmware, and security perspectives: run mixed-signal cosims, hardware/software co-verification, and security assertions within the same plan.

### Risk-based execution
Score features by novelty and impact; allocate regression time, formal proofs, and emulation slots accordingly.

## Make It Work
1. **Central plan:** Maintain a living feature/risk matrix with owners, stimuli, and exit criteria.
2. **Shared infrastructure:** Provide SoC virtual sequencers, reference scoreboards, and logging policies all teams consume.
3. **Scenario library:** Curate virtual sequences (boot-from-X, DMA-stress, power-cycle) parameterized for subsystems.
4. **Cross-tool handoffs:** Export formal counterexamples to UVM seeds; feed emulation logs back to scoreboard checks.

**Checklist before moving on:**
- [ ] Every IP agent you reuse supports passive mode and feeds SoC scoreboards.
- [ ] Feature/risk matrix exists with status per methodology (UVM/formal/emulation).
- [ ] System scenarios are versioned and parameterized.
- [ ] Debug handoffs (counterexample → UVM test) are scripted.

## Push Further
- **Unified dashboards:** Merge UVM coverage, formal proof status, and emulation run health into one view.
- **Hardware acceleration:** Offload long-running system scenarios to emulation/prototyping.
- **Resilience testing:** Inject faults (clock glitches, secure partition breaches) via scripted sequences.
- **Continuous integration:** Run smoke SoC scenarios on every build; gate releases on cross-methodology sign-off.

## Practice & Reinforce
- Convert an IP-level agent to passive and integrate it into a SoC scoreboard.
- Build a feature table linking boot, DMA, and low-power scenarios to responsible sequences and coverage goals.
- Run a SoC virtual sequence that coordinates CPU, DMA, and memory agents; record transactions for debug.
- Align with [/curriculum/T4_Expert/E-INT-1_Integrating_UVM_with_Formal_Verification/index](../E-INT-1_Integrating_UVM_with_Formal_Verification/index) to ensure assertions cover the same features.
