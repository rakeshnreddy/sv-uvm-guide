## Level 1: Definition

Coverage closure means all planned coverage points have been hit and analyzed. It's the signal that testing requirements are satisfied.

## Level 2: Workflow

1. Review coverage reports nightly.
2. Compare against the V-Plan entries.
3. Use results to guide new random seeds or directed tests.

  question: "What does a hole in coverage indicate?",
  options: ["A failing regression", "A scenario not yet observed", "An unconnected DUT port"],
  correctAnswer: "A scenario not yet observed"

## Level 3: Expert Notes

Experienced teams automate report parsing to highlight meaningful gaps. They focus effort on coverage items tied to customer requirements rather than trivial toggles.
