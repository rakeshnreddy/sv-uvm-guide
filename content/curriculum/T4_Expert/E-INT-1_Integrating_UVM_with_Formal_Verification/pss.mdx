## Level 1

PSS describes tests at a higher abstraction so they can run on simulation, emulation, or silicon with minimal changes.

## Level 2

No code neededâ€”think of PSS as a language for expressing scenarios and constraints. Tools generate sequences for different platforms.

## Level 3

While promising, PSS requires tool buy-in and a shift in mindset from test to intent modeling.
