## Level 1: The Elevator Pitch

**What is it?** UVM is a flexible methodology that can be customized to meet the specific needs of your project. This can involve creating custom base classes, defining custom phases, and developing project-specific coding guidelines.

**The Analogy:** Think of UVM as a "custom-built suit". You start with a standard pattern, but you can tailor it to fit your exact measurements.

**Why this matters:** Customizing UVM can help you to create a more efficient and effective verification environment. It can also help to ensure that your testbenches are consistent and maintainable.

## Level 2: The Practical Explanation

### Custom Base Classes

You can create your own custom base classes that inherit from the UVM base classes. This allows you to add your own project-specific functionality to the UVM library.

### Custom Phases

You can define your own custom phases to run alongside the standard run-time phases. This allows you for fine-grained control over testbench execution.

### Coding Guidelines

It's important to establish a set of coding guidelines for your project. This will help to ensure that your testbenches are consistent and maintainable.

## Level 3: Expert Insights

**Don't reinvent the wheel:** Before you create your own custom base classes or phases, make sure that there isn't already a standard UVM feature that does what you need.

**Keep it simple:** Don't over-customize your environment. The more you customize, the harder it will be for other people to understand and use your testbenches.

**Memory & Retention Tip:** Remember: **Customize with a purpose.**
