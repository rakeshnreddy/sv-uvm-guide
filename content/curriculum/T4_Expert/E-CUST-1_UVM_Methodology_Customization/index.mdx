## Level 1: What Is a V-Plan?

A **Verification Plan (V-Plan)** is the blueprint linking requirements to tests and coverage. It answers *"what must we verify?"* and provides measurable goals.

> Like architectural drawings for a house, the V-Plan ensures every feature is accounted for before building begins.

## Level 2: Planning & Coverage Strategy

<Alert>Maintain a single source of truth. Features, tests, and coverage points should trace back to the V-Plan.</Alert>

A typical document lists DUT features, associated test scenarios, and the functional coverage items that prove those scenarios occurred. Coverage reports feed back into the plan to track closure progress.

<Quiz questions={[{
  question: "Which metric indicates coverage closure?",
  options: ["Functional coverage", "Lines of code", "Simulation time", "Bug count"],
  correctAnswer: "Functional coverage"
}]}/>

## Level 3: Veteran Commentary

Seasoned engineers treat the V-Plan as a living contract. During regression triage, failing tests are mapped back to plan items so gaps become immediately visible. It's less about hitting 100% and more about demonstrating intent coverage.
