## Level 1: The Elevator Pitch

**What is it?** UVM is a flexible methodology that can be customized to meet the specific needs of your project. This can involve creating custom base classes, defining custom phases, and developing project-specific coding guidelines.

**The Analogy:** Think of UVM as a "custom-built suit". You start with a standard pattern, but you can tailor it to fit your exact measurements.

**Why this matters:** Customizing UVM can help you to create a more efficient and effective verification environment. It can also help to ensure that your testbenches are consistent and maintainable.

## Level 2: Core Customization Techniques

### Creating a Custom Component Base Class

A common customization is to create a project-specific base class for all components. This allows you to inject common functionality, like a handle to a central configuration object or a standardized logging interface, into every component in your environment.

<InteractiveCode
  language="systemverilog"
  fileName="custom_base_class.sv"
  code={`
// 1. Define a central configuration object
class proj_config extends uvm_object;
  // ... project-specific config fields ...
endclass

// 2. Create a custom base class for all components
class proj_component extends uvm_component;
  `uvm_component_utils(proj_component)

  proj_config m_cfg; // Handle to the project config object

  function new(string name, uvm_component parent);
    super.new(name, parent);
  endfunction

  function void build_phase(uvm_phase phase);
    super.build_phase(phase);
    // Get the config object from the config_db
    if (!$cast(m_cfg, uvm_config_db#(uvm_object)::get(this, "", "proj_config")))
      `uvm_fatal("NO_CFG", "Failed to get project config object")
  endfunction
endclass

// 3. All other components now extend from the project base class
class my_driver extends proj_component;
  // ... now has access to m_cfg automatically ...
endclass
  `}
  explanationSteps={[

    { target: "2-5", title: "Project Configuration Object", explanation: "First, we define a central configuration object for our project. This will hold all the key configuration parameters for the environment." },
    { target: "8-22", title: "Custom Base Component", explanation: "This is our custom base class, `proj_component`. It extends `uvm_component` and adds a handle (`m_cfg`) for the project configuration object. In its `build_phase`, it automatically gets this configuration object from the `uvm_config_db`." },
    { target: "25-27", title: "Extending the Custom Base", explanation: "Now, instead of extending `uvm_driver`, our `my_driver` extends `proj_component`. Because it inherits from `proj_component`, it automatically has the `m_cfg` handle and the logic to retrieve it, reducing boilerplate code in every single component." }
  ]}
/>

### Defining Custom UVM Phases

While UVM provides a comprehensive set of phases, sometimes you need to insert a custom phase for a specific synchronization point in your testbench. For example, you might need a `load_firmware_phase` that runs after the DUT is reset but before the main test stimulus begins.

<InteractiveCode
  language="systemverilog"
  fileName="custom_phase.sv"
  code={`
// 1. Define the custom phase class
class load_firmware_phase extends uvm_task_phase;
  `uvm_object_utils(load_firmware_phase)
  static local load_firmware_phase m_inst;

  function new(string name = "load_firmware");
    super.new(name);
  endfunction

  static function load_firmware_phase get();
    if (m_inst == null) m_inst = new();
    return m_inst;
  endfunction
endclass

// 2. Create a custom phase schedule
function void my_test::build_phase(uvm_phase phase);
  uvm_phase run_phases[];
  // ...
  // Insert the custom phase after 'reset_phase'
  uvm_domain::get_common_domain().m_add_phase(load_firmware_phase::get(),
                                             .after_phase(uvm_reset_phase::get()));
endfunction

// 3. Implemented the custom phase task in a component
task my_driver::load_firmware_phase(uvm_phase phase);
  // ... code to load firmware into DUT memory via backdoor ...
endtask
  `}
  explanationSteps={[
    { target: "2-14", title: "Defining the Phase Class", explanation: "First, you define your custom phase class, inheriting from `uvm_task_phase` (for tasks) or `uvm_func_phase` (for functions). It's implemented as a singleton, so there's only one instance of it in the simulation." },
    { target: "17-22", title: "Inserting the Phase", explanation: "In your test or base test, you get the common UVM domain and use the `m_add_phase` method to insert your custom phase into the schedule. Here, we place it immediately after the standard `reset_phase`." },
    { target: "25-27", title: "Implementing the Phase Method", explanation: "Finally, you implement the corresponding phase method in the components that need to participate. The simulator will automatically call this `load_firmware_phase` task at the correct point in the simulation." }
  ]}
/>

## Level 3: Advanced Integration & Strategy

### Methodology Customization Patterns

- **The "Hook" Pattern:** Instead of forcing users to extend your base classes, you can provide "hooks" for customization. A hook is simply an empty virtual method in your base class (e.g., `virtual function void post_configure();`). A user can then extend your class and override this method to add their own functionality without having to understand or call the parent class's implementation. This is a less intrusive way to allow customization.

- **Policy and Linting:** A key part of methodology is enforcement. Your custom methodology should be accompanied by a set of linting rules (e.g., using SpyGlass or AscentLint) and coding guidelines. For example, you can enforce a rule that all components must extend `proj_component`, not `uvm_component`.

### Advanced Tool Integration: CI for Methodology

Your UVM methodology is a software project and should be treated as such.
- **Version Control:** Your methodology code should live in its own Git repository.
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Set up a CI pipeline (e.g., using Jenkins or GitLab CI) that automatically runs a set of "smoke tests" every time a change is committed to the methodology repository. This ensures that a change to a base class doesn't accidentally break hundreds of projects that depend on it.
- **Release Management:** Have a clear release versioning scheme (e.g., `v1.0`, `v1.1`, `v2.0`) for your methodology. Projects should be able to "pin" to a specific version of the methodology to ensure stability, and only upgrade when they are ready.

### Expanding the Methodology to Advanced Domains

- **Performance Optimization:** Profile critical components and provide configuration switches for lightweight "fast" modes that keep regressions running efficiently.
- **Debug Methodology:** Standardize logging, waveform bookmarks, and failure triage APIs so engineers can diagnose issues quickly across projects.
- **SoC-Level Verification:** Support hierarchical configuration, multi-IP coordination, and top-level scoreboards required for complex SoC environments.

### Formal Verification Integration

Bridging simulation and formal flows lets teams reuse properties and close coverage more efficiently.

<InteractiveCode
  language="systemverilog"
  fileName="reusable_property.sv"
  code={`
// 1. Define the property once in a package
package arb_props;
  property req_gnt;
    @(posedge clk) req |-> ##[1:2] gnt;
  endproperty
endpackage

// 2. Bind the property into the design
bind arbiter arb_props req_gnt_assert: assert property(arb_props::req_gnt);

// 3. Cover to track closure in both sim and formal
cover property (@(posedge clk) req ##1 gnt);
  `}
  explanationSteps={[
    { target: "2-6", title: "Reusable Property", explanation: "Package the property so the same definition is shared across simulation and formal runs." },
    { target: "8-9", title: "Binding", explanation: "Bind the property to the DUT to avoid modifying RTL." },
    { target: "11-11", title: "Coverage Closure", explanation: "Cover directives help determine when the property has been exercised." }
  ]}
/>

**Best Practices Checklist**

- [ ] Collect assertions in shared packages for reuse.
- [ ] Track both assertion and cover property metrics to drive coverage closure.
- [ ] Use `bind` so RTL remains untouched.

### Leadership & Strategy for Methodology Rollout

Rolling out a custom methodology across teams requires planning, tooling, and clear ownership.

<InteractiveCode
  language="bash"
  fileName="rollout.sh"
  code={`#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e
git clone https://git.example.com/uvm_methodology.git
cd uvm_methodology
npm ci
./install_hooks.sh ../my_project
  `}
  explanationSteps={[
    { target: "1-6", title: "Bootstrap Script", explanation: "Automates fetching the methodology repository and installing standard hooks into a new project." }
  ]}
/>

**Best Practices Checklist**

- [ ] Nominate a methodology owner or steering committee.
- [ ] Pilot the flow on a small project before organization-wide rollout.
- [ ] Provide versioned documentation and regular training sessions.

### Cutting-Edge Topics: Cloud & ML Customization

Emerging trends like cloud-based regression farms and ML-driven configuration can further optimize verification.

<InteractiveCode
  language="python"
  fileName="ml_config.py"
  code={`import requests
import yaml
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

def choose_seed(history):
  model = RandomForestClassifier().fit(history['features'], history['labels'])
  return int(model.predict([history['current']])[0])

cfg = requests.get("https://config.example.com/myproj").json()
cfg['seed'] = choose_seed(cfg['history'])
print(yaml.dump(cfg))
  `}
  explanationSteps={[
    { target: "1-3", title: "Cloud & ML Imports", explanation: "Pull configuration from a cloud service and use an ML model to predict parameters." },
    { target: "5-7", title: "Model Training", explanation: "Train a simple classifier on past regression data." },
    { target: "9-10", title: "ML-Assisted Config", explanation: "Update the configuration with an ML-selected random seed." }
  ]}
/>

**Best Practices Checklist**

- [ ] Externalize configuration so cloud jobs can override parameters easily.
- [ ] Use ML models to prioritize tests or tune random seeds based on history.
- [ ] Monitor resource usage and costs in cloud environments.

## Level 4: Architect's Corner

### Case Study: A Custom Base Library for a Networking SoC

**The Challenge:** An organization is developing multiple networking SoCs. Each SoC has dozens of Ethernet MACs, interconnects, and other common components. The goal is to maximize verification reuse and efficiency across all these projects.

**The Anti-Pattern:** Each project team develops their own base classes and methodology from scratch. This leads to divergence, duplicated effort, and makes it difficult for engineers to move between projects.

**The Architectural Solution: `net_uvm_lib`**

A central methodology team was created to develop and maintain a `net_uvm_lib` package. This was a company-wide, standardized UVM extension library.

1.  **Custom Base Classes:**
    *   `net_component extends uvm_component`: Added a handle to a central `net_config` object and an interface to a company-wide debug and logging system.
    *   `net_driver extends uvm_driver`: Added built-in functional coverage for basic bus protocol correctness (e.g., "was a packet of every possible length driven?").
    *   `net_monitor extends uvm_monitor`: Added built-in protocol checkers that could be enabled or disabled via the `net_config` object.

2.  **Standardized TLM Interfaces:**
    *   The library defined a standard `net_packet_c` class that was used for all packet-based communication between components (e.g., from monitor to scoreboard). This ensured all components spoke the same language.

3.  **Custom Phases:**
    *   A `program_pll_phase` was added to configure the DUT's PLLs before any other activity.
    *   A `check_clocks_gates_phase` was added at the end of the test to automatically check that all clock gates were in their expected state.

4.  **Factory and Configuration:**
    *   The `base_test` for all networking projects included a standard set of factory overrides to ensure all components used the `net_*` base classes.
    *   The `net_config` object provided a centralized place to control everything: enable/disable coverage, turn on/off protocol checkers, set verbosity for different agents, etc.

**The Outcome:** The `net_uvm_lib` was a huge success. Project teams could build complex environments much faster because they were starting from a rich, pre-validated foundation. Regression debug was easier because all testbenches had a consistent structure and logging format. Engineers could move between projects with minimal ramp-up time. This initial investment in a custom methodology paid for itself many times over in increased productivity and quality.
