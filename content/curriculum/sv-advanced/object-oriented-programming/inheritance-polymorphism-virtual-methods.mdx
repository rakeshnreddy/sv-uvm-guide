# Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Virtual Methods

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a cornerstone of modern verification methodologies like UVM, and SystemVerilog provides robust OOP capabilities. Key among these are inheritance, polymorphism, and virtual methods, which allow for creating flexible, extensible, and reusable verification components and data structures. This section is based on concepts from IEEE 1800-2017, Clause 8.

## Theory

### Class Inheritance (`extends`)

*   **Concept:** Inheritance allows a new class (called a **derived class** or **subclass**) to acquire the properties (data members) and methods (functions and tasks) of an existing class (called a **base class** or **superclass**).
*   **Syntax:** The `extends` keyword is used to define an inheritance relationship.
    ```systemverilog
    class BaseClass;
      // Base class members
    endclass

    class DerivedClass extends BaseClass;
      // Derived class can access BaseClass members
      // and add its own specific members
    endclass
    ```
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Code Reusability:** Avoids redundant code by inheriting common functionality.
    *   **Extensibility:** Allows adding new features or specializing behavior in derived classes without modifying the base class.
    *   **Hierarchical Classification:** Creates a natural "is-a" relationship (e.g., an `EthPacket` *is a* `Packet`).

### Polymorphism

*   **Concept:** Polymorphism (from Greek, meaning "many forms") allows a base class handle (pointer or reference) to hold an object of any of its derived classes. This means you can write code that operates on base class handles, and it will behave correctly regardless of the actual derived class object being referenced.
*   **Mechanism:** In SystemVerilog, when a base class handle stores a derived class object, you can call methods defined in the base class using that handle. The actual method executed depends on the object's type and whether the method is `virtual`.
*   **Example Scenario:** You might have an array of `Packet` handles, where some elements point to `EthPacket` objects and others to `UsbPacket` objects.

### Virtual Methods

*   **Problem Solved:** Consider a base class `Packet` with a `print()` method, and derived classes `EthPacket` and `UsbPacket` that also have their own `print()` methods. If you have a `Packet` handle `p` pointing to an `EthPacket` object, and you call `p.print()`, which `print()` method should be called?
    *   If `print()` in the base class is **not** `virtual`, the base class version of `print()` is called (this is determined at compile time based on the handle type). This is often not what's desired.
    *   If `print()` in the base class is declared as **`virtual`**, the version of `print()` corresponding to the **actual object type** (`EthPacket` in this case) is called. This is determined at runtime and is the essence of polymorphic behavior.
*   **Syntax:** The `virtual` keyword is used when declaring the method in the base class.
    ```systemverilog
    class BaseClass;
      virtual function void display();
        $display("BaseClass display");
      endfunction
    endclass

    class DerivedClass extends BaseClass;
      // Override the virtual method
      virtual function void display(); // 'virtual' keyword is optional here but good practice
        $display("DerivedClass display");
      endfunction
    endclass
    ```
*   **Rule:** If a method is declared `virtual` in a base class, it remains `virtual` in all derived classes, whether or not the `virtual` keyword is repeated in the derived class. It's good practice to repeat it for clarity.
*   **Constructors (`new`) are never virtual.**

## Example: Packet Hierarchy

Let's illustrate these concepts with a classic example of a generic `Packet` class and specific packet types.

```systemverilog
// Base class Packet
class Packet;
  string name;
  int    id;

  // Constructor
  function new(string name = "GenericPacket", int id = 0);
    this.name = name;
    this.id = id;
  endfunction

  // Virtual method to print packet details
  virtual function void print_info();
    $display("[%0s] ID: %0d", name, id);
  endfunction

  virtual function void process();
    $display("[%0s] Performing generic processing.", name);
  endfunction
endclass

// Derived class EthPacket
class EthPacket extends Packet;
  logic [47:0] src_mac;
  logic [47:0] dst_mac;

  function new(string name = "EthPacket", int id = 1, logic [47:0] src_mac = 48'hAABBCC001122, logic [47:0] dst_mac = 48'hDDEEFF334455);
    super.new(name, id); // Call base class constructor
    this.src_mac = src_mac;
    this.dst_mac = dst_mac;
  endfunction

  // Override the virtual print_info method
  virtual function void print_info();
    super.print_info(); // Optionally call base class method
    $display("  L2 Info: SRC MAC: %h, DST MAC: %h", src_mac, dst_mac);
  endfunction

  // Override the virtual process method
  virtual function void process();
    $display("[%0s] Processing Ethernet headers...", name);
    // Specific Ethernet processing logic
  endfunction
endclass

// Derived class UsbPacket
class UsbPacket extends Packet;
  typedef enum { SETUP, DATA, ACK } UsbPacketType;
  UsbPacketType type;

  function new(string name = "UsbPacket", int id = 2, UsbPacketType type = UsbPacketType.DATA);
    super.new(name, id); // Call base class constructor
    this.type = type;
  endfunction

  // Override the virtual print_info method
  virtual function void print_info();
    super.print_info(); // Optionally call base class method
    $display("  USB Info: Type: %s", type.name());
  endfunction

  // Override the virtual process method
  virtual function void process();
    $display("[%0s] Processing USB transaction type %s...", name, type.name());
    // Specific USB processing logic
  endfunction
endclass

// Test module to demonstrate polymorphism
module test_oop;
  initial begin
    Packet pkt_handles[3]; // Array of base class handles

    // Create objects of derived classes and assign to base class handles
    pkt_handles[0] = new("BasePkt", 100);         // A base Packet object
    pkt_handles[1] = new EthPacket("EthPkt-A", 101, 48'h112233AABBCC, 48'h445566DDEEFF);
    pkt_handles[2] = new UsbPacket("UsbPkt-X", 102, UsbPacket.SETUP);

    $display("--- Demonstrating Polymorphism via virtual print_info() ---");
    foreach (pkt_handles[i]) begin
      if (pkt_handles[i] != null) begin
        $display("Calling print_info() for element %0d:", i);
        pkt_handles[i].print_info(); // Calls the appropriate derived class version
        $display("");
      end
    end

    $display("--- Demonstrating Polymorphism via virtual process() ---");
    foreach (pkt_handles[i]) begin
      if (pkt_handles[i] != null) begin
        pkt_handles[i].process(); // Calls the appropriate derived class version
      end
    end
  end
endmodule
```

**Explanation of the Example:**

1.  **`Packet` (Base Class):** Defines a `name`, `id`, and a `virtual function void print_info()` and `virtual function void process()`.
2.  **`EthPacket` (Derived Class):** `extends Packet`, adds `src_mac` and `dst_mac`, and *overrides* `print_info()` and `process()` to include Ethernet-specific details. It calls `super.new()` to initialize base class members and `super.print_info()` to include generic packet info.
3.  **`UsbPacket` (Derived Class):** `extends Packet`, adds `type` (an enum), and *overrides* `print_info()` and `process()` for USB-specific details.
4.  **`test_oop` Module:**
    *   An array `pkt_handles` of type `Packet` is declared. This array can hold handles to `Packet` objects or any object derived from `Packet`.
    *   Objects of `Packet`, `EthPacket`, and `UsbPacket` are created and their handles are stored in `pkt_handles`.
    *   When `pkt_handles[i].print_info()` or `pkt_handles[i].process()` is called in the loop, SystemVerilog checks the actual type of the object stored at `pkt_handles[i]`. Because `print_info` and `process` are `virtual`, the version of the method specific to that object's class (`EthPacket::print_info` or `UsbPacket::print_info`) is executed. This is polymorphism in action.

## UVM Context

The concepts of inheritance, polymorphism, and especially **virtual methods** are absolutely fundamental to the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM).

*   **UVM Base Classes:** UVM provides a rich set of base classes (e.g., `uvm_object`, `uvm_component`, `uvm_sequence_item`, `uvm_driver`). Your custom verification components and transaction items will typically extend these base classes.
*   **UVM Phasing Methods:** Methods like `build_phase`, `connect_phase`, `run_phase`, etc., in `uvm_component` are `virtual`. This allows you to override them in your custom components to define specific behavior for each phase. When the UVM framework calls `component.build_phase()`, it's the version you implemented in your derived component that gets executed.
*   **UVM Factory and Overrides:**
    *   The UVM factory mechanism heavily relies on polymorphism. You can request the factory to create an object of a certain base type.
    *   Later, you can configure the factory to *override* that base type with a derived type, often for specific tests or configurations. When the factory creates the object, it will now provide an instance of the derived type, but it can still be assigned to a base type handle.
    *   This allows for powerful test customization without changing the core testbench structure. For example, you could replace a generic `my_packet` with an `error_injecting_packet` for a specific test case, and existing code using `my_packet` handles will automatically use the error-injecting version if its methods are virtual.

Understanding inheritance, polymorphism, and virtual methods is therefore essential not just for general SystemVerilog OOP but is a prerequisite for effective UVM adoption. These features enable the creation of highly modular, reusable, and configurable verification environments.
