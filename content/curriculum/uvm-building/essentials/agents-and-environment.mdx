## Level 1: Definitions and Analogies

An Agent is a **team**: driver, sequencer, and monitor. An Environment is the **department** that groups one or more agents with scoreboards and other components.

## Level 2: Connecting Components

```systemverilog
class my_agent extends uvm_agent;
  `uvm_component_utils(my_agent)
  my_driver d;
  my_sequencer s;
  my_monitor m;
  function void build_phase(uvm_phase phase);
    super.build_phase(phase);
    if (is_active) begin
      d = my_driver::type_id::create("d", this);
      s = my_sequencer::type_id::create("s", this);
    end
    m = my_monitor::type_id::create("m", this);
  endfunction
endclass
```

## Level 3: Advanced Practices

* Use a **virtual sequencer** in the environment to coordinate multiple agents.
* Passive agents are ideal for system-level observation without stimulus.
