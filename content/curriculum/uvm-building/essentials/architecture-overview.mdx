## Level 1: Definitions and Analogies

A UVM testbench resembles a **department** in a company. Each Agent is a small team (driver, sequencer, monitor) and the Environment is the department that brings teams together under a single manager – the `uvm_test`.

## Level 3: Best Practices

* Keep agents self‑contained for reuse.
* Top environments often compose multiple agents and scoreboards.
