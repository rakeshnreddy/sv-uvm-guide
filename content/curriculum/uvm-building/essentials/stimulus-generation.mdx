## Level 1: The Elevator Pitch

**What is it?** Stimulus generation is the process of creating and sending transactions to the DUT. In UVM, this is done using sequences and sequencers.

**The Analogy:** Think of a sequence as a "recipe" for a test. The sequencer is the "chef" who follows the recipe and sends the "dishes" (transactions) to the "waiter" (the driver), who then delivers them to the "customer" (the DUT).

**Why this matters:** Separating the stimulus generation (the "what") from the driving (the "how") is a key principle of UVM. It allows you to create reusable stimulus scenarios that can be used with different drivers and different DUTs.

## Level 2: The Practical Explanation

### The Sequence/Driver Handshake

1.  **`get_next_item()`:** The driver calls `seq_item_port.get_next_item(req)` to request a transaction from the sequencer. This is a blocking call.
2.  **`start_item()`/`finish_item()`:** A sequence running on the sequencer creates a transaction and sends it to the driver using `start_item()` and `finish_item()`.
3.  **`item_done()`:** After the driver has finished driving the transaction, it calls `seq_item_port.item_done()` to signal completion to the sequencer.

<InteractiveCode>
```systemverilog
// In the driver's run_phase:
forever begin
  seq_item_port.get_next_item(req);
  // Drive the transaction
  seq_item_port.item_done();
end
```
</InteractiveCode>

## Level 3: Expert Insights

**`uvm_do` Macros:** The `uvm_do` macros (`uvm_do`, `uvm_do_with`, etc.) are a convenient shortcut for creating, randomizing, and sending a transaction. However, they can sometimes make your code harder to read and debug.

**Sequence Layering:** You can create complex stimulus scenarios by layering sequences. A high-level sequence can execute other, lower-level sequences.

**Memory & Retention Tip:** Remember: **Sequence = The What.** **Driver = The How.**

      "explanation": "Forgetting to call `item_done()` is a very common bug. It prevents the sequencer from unblocking and sending the next transaction, causing the testbench to hang."
