  ## Level 1: The Big Idea

  A **mailbox** is a built-in message queue. One process `put`s an item into the mailbox while another `get`s it out. It's like dropping a letter into a box for someone else to pick up later.

  ## Level 2: Practical Usage

  ### Basic Operations

  | Call | Blocking? | Use it when |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `put(item)` | Blocks if the mailbox is full | Backpressure producer threads until consumers catch up. |
  | `try_put(item)` | Returns 0 if full | Drop low-priority work instead of stalling. |
  | `get(item)` | Blocks until something arrives | Classic producer/consumer handshakes. |
  | `try_get(item)` | Returns 0 if empty | Poll without blocking a monitor. |
  | `peek(item)` | Non-destructive read | Look at the next transaction while leaving it queued. |
  | `num()` | Instant | Inspect queue depth for assertions or adaptive throttling. |

  ```systemverilog
  typedef struct { int id; bit [7:0] data; } packet_t;
  mailbox #(packet_t) mbx = new(4); // depth-limited queue

  task automatic produce_packet(int id);
    packet_t p = '{id: id, data: $urandom_range(0, 255)};
    if (!mbx.try_put(p)) begin
      // Backpressure: wait for space, then block on put
      wait (mbx.num() < 4);
      mbx.put(p);
    end
  endtask

  initial begin
    for (int idx = 0; idx < 8; idx++) begin
      produce_packet(idx);
    end
  end

  initial begin
    packet_t pkt;
    forever begin
      mbx.get(pkt);
      $display("[%0t] Consumer saw id=%0d depth=%0d", $time, pkt.id, mbx.num());
    end
  end
  ```

  Mailboxes often carry randomized transactions. For generating those transactions, see [Constrained Randomization](/curriculum/T2_Intermediate/I-SV-2_Constrained_Randomization).

  ## Level 3: Expert Insights

  **Bounded vs. unbounded:** `new()` with no arguments gives you an infinite queue—useful for scoreboards, dangerous for drivers that might overrun memory. Set a depth to spot backpressure issues during bring-up.

  **Typed mailboxes:** Parameterized mailboxes (`mailbox#(packet_t)`) prevent accidental mixing of transaction types. Pair them with `typedef`ed structs so refactors stay safe.

  **Monitoring depth:** `mbx.num()` is a quick health indicator—assert it never exceeds your architectural limits, or expose it via telemetry to visualize congestion.

  **Mailboxes vs. TLM/FIFOs:** UVM’s `uvm_tlm_fifo` wraps a mailbox with analysis ports, reset control, and blocking/non-blocking APIs. Reach for it when you need producer/consumer plus broadcast behavior; stick with raw mailboxes for lightweight handshakes.

  **One-to-one only:** Mailboxes always deliver each message to a single consumer. When you need broadcast semantics, rely on [analysis ports](/curriculum/T2_Intermediate/I-UVM-2_Building_TB/index#monitors-scoreboards-and-the-analysis-fabric) or register callbacks.

  ## Quiz

  <Quiz questions={[
    {
      question: "What happens when `get()` is called on an empty mailbox?",
      answers: [
        { text: "It returns immediately with a default value", correct: false },
        { text: "It blocks until an item is available", correct: true },
        { text: "It deletes the mailbox", correct: false },
        { text: "It throws a runtime error", correct: false }
      ],
      explanation: "`get()` blocks the calling process until data is present in the mailbox."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you create a mailbox with a depth of 4 packets?",
      answers: [
        { text: "`mailbox mbx = new;`", correct: false },
        { text: "`mailbox #(packet) mbx = new(4);`", correct: true },
        { text: "`mailbox[4] mbx;`", correct: false },
        { text: "`mailbox mbx[4];`", correct: false }
      ],
      explanation: "Passing a number to `new` sets the mailbox depth."
