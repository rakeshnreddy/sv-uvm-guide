  ## Level 1: The Big Idea

  An **event** is a simple synchronization object. One process can signal an event, and another can wait for it. It's like ringing a doorbell and waiting for someone to answer.

  ## Level 2: Practical Usage

  ### Declaring and Triggering

  -   Declare an event: `event done;`
  -   Trigger it: `-> done;`
  -   Wait for it: `@done;`

  <InteractiveCode>
  ```systemverilog
  event start;

  initial begin
    // Stimulus thread
    #10 -> start;      // trigger the event
  end

  initial begin
    // Monitor thread
    @start;             // wait for trigger
    $display("Started at %0t", $time);
  end
  ```
  </InteractiveCode>

  Events often coordinate randomized stimulus or monitor actions. Review [Constrained Randomization](/curriculum/T2_Intermediate/I-SV-2_Constrained_Randomization) to see how events can trigger new random transactions.

  ## Level 3: Expert Insights

  **Multiple Triggers:** An event can be triggered repeatedly; waiting processes react to each trigger.

  **`wait_order`:** Use `wait_order(e1, e2)` to ensure events occur in sequence.

  **`uvm_event`:** UVM provides `uvm_event` with additional features like callbacks and history. See [analysis components](/curriculum/uvm-building/essentials/analysis-components) for how events can work alongside analysis ports.

  ## Quiz

  <Quiz questions={[
    {
      question: "Which statement waits for event `go` to be triggered?",
      answers: [
        { text: "`-> go;`", correct: false },
        { text: "`@go;`", correct: true },
        { text: "`wait(go);`", correct: false },
        { text: "`disable go;`", correct: false }
      ],
      explanation: "`@go;` suspends the process until the event `go` is triggered."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you trigger an event named `done`?",
      answers: [
        { text: "`@done;`", correct: false },
        { text: "`-> done;`", correct: true },
        { text: "`event done;`", correct: false },
        { text: "`done.trigger();`", correct: false }
      ],
