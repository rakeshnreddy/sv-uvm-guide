## Quick Take
- **What it is:** The next level of SystemVerilog Assertions. We move beyond simple single-clock protocols to handle asynchronous boundary crossings, store dynamic state inside sequences, and attach verification IP directly to the DUT without touching its source code.
- **Why it matters:** Real-world designs have multiple clock domains and complex data-dependent pipelines. Advanced SVA is required to verify these structures robustly.
