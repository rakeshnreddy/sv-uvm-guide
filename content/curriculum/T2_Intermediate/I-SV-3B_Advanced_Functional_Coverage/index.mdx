## Quick Take
- **What it is:** The next step in functional coverage, moving from collecting data to actively utilizing it. This involves linking coverage back to the verification plan, querying results from the testbench, and dynamically altering stimulus based on coverage holes.
- **Why it matters:** Senior verification engineers don't just write covergroups; they build closed-loop systems where the testbench automatically adjusts its focus until 100% of the plan is covered.
