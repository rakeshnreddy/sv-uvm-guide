## UVM Base Classes: `uvm_object` vs. `uvm_component`

`uvm_object` and `uvm_component` form the root of every UVM class. Think of `uvm_object` as a **package** that is shipped around, while `uvm_component` is a **building** permanently placed in the testbench city. The base classes exist so that every piece of data or infrastructure in UVM follows common creation and reporting rules.

<UvmHierarchySunburstChart />

* `uvm_component` participates in phasing; forgetting `super.build_phase` can break hierarchies.
* `uvm_object` derived classes should use the `clone` method when copying to preserve factory type.
* Remember: **"Components are buildings, objects are packages"** – a quick mnemonic seasoned engineers repeat.

## The UVM Factory

The UVM factory is a powerful mechanism that allows you to **replace the type of an object being created without changing a single line of the source code that creates it.**

### The Three Core Mechanics of the Factory

The factory operates on a simple three-step process: **Register, Create, and Override.**

#### 1. Registration (`uvm_*_utils`)

A class must be "registered" with the factory to be eligible for creation and overrides. This is like getting a birth certificate. We use the `uvm_object_utils` macro for `uvm_object`-based classes and `uvm_component_utils` for `uvm_component`-based classes.

```systemverilog
import uvm_pkg::*;
`include "uvm_macros.svh"

class base_packet extends uvm_sequence_item;
  // Registration with the factory
  `uvm_object_utils(base_packet)

  // Constructor
  function new(string name = "base_packet");
    super.new(name);
  endfunction
endclass
```

#### 2. Creation (`create()`)

To allow the factory to work its magic, you **must never call `new()` directly** for UVM objects and components. Instead, you must always use the factory's `create()` method. This is the "hook" that allows the factory to intercept the request and perform an override if one is registered.

```systemverilog
// In some component (e.g., a driver)
...
base_packet my_pkt;
// Instead of my_pkt = new();
// We use the factory to create the object.
my_pkt = base_packet::type_id::create("my_pkt");
...
```

#### 3. Overrides (`set_*_override`)

In your test, you can instruct the factory to substitute one type for another. There are two main ways to do this:

-   **Type Override:** Replace *all* instances of a certain type with another type.
-   **Instance Override:** Replace a *specific instance* of a certain type with another type, based on its path in the component hierarchy.

<InteractiveCode>
```systemverilog
import uvm_pkg::*;
`include "uvm_macros.svh"

// 1. The base packet class
class base_packet extends uvm_sequence_item;
  `uvm_object_utils(base_packet)
  function new(string name = "base_packet");
    super.new(name);
  endfunction
  virtual function void print_type();
    `uvm_info("PKTTYPE", "This is a base_packet", UVM_LOW)
  endfunction
endclass

// 2. The special error packet class
class error_packet extends base_packet;
  `uvm_object_utils(error_packet)
  function new(string name = "error_packet");
    super.new(name);
  endfunction
  virtual function void print_type();
    `uvm_info("PKTTYPE", "This is an **error_packet**", UVM_LOW)
  endfunction
endclass

// 3. An environment component that creates packets
class my_env extends uvm_env;
  `uvm_component_utils(my_env)
  function new(string name, uvm_component parent);
    super.new(name, parent);
  endfunction
  task run_phase(uvm_phase phase);
    base_packet pkt;
    phase.raise_objection(this);
    `uvm_info("ENV", "Creating a packet...", UVM_LOW)
    // The environment *thinks* it's creating a base_packet
    pkt = base_packet::type_id::create("pkt");
    pkt.print_type();
    phase.drop_objection(this);
  endtask
endclass

// 4. The test that applies the override
class my_test extends uvm_test;
  `uvm_component_utils(my_test)
  my_env env;
  function new(string name, uvm_component parent);
    super.new(name, parent);
  endfunction

  function void build_phase(uvm_phase phase);
    super.build_phase(phase);
    // Set the factory override BEFORE the environment is built
    `uvm_info("TEST", "Setting factory override: base_packet -> error_packet", UVM_LOW)
    factory.set_type_override_by_type(base_packet::get_type(),
                                      error_packet::get_type());
    env = my_env::type_id::create("env", this);
  endfunction
endclass

module top;
  initial run_test("my_test");
endmodule
```
</InteractiveCode>

## Phasing

UVM phasing is the **schedule** that orchestrates every component. Like stages of a concert rehearsal, components prepare (`build_phase`), connect instruments (`connect_phase`), perform (`run_phase`), and wrap up (`report_phase`).

<UvmPhasingDiagram />

* Always call `super.build_phase` and friends to ensure parents create children.
* Phases can be jumped with `phase.jump(uvm_reset_phase::get())`, but use sparingly.
* Remember: **"Phasing is the rehearsal schedule"** – keep components in sync.

## Quiz

<Quiz questions={[
    {
      "question": "To replace ALL instances of `my_driver` with `my_error_driver` throughout the entire testbench, which factory method is most appropriate?",
      "answers": [
        {"text": "`set_inst_override_by_name`", "correct": false},
        {"text": "`set_type_override_by_type`", "correct": true},

        {"text": "`set_inst_override`", "correct": false}
      ],
      "explanation": "`set_type_override_by_type` performs a global replacement of one type with another, which is exactly what is needed for a testbench-wide substitution."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why must we use the `factory.create()` method instead of the SystemVerilog `new()` constructor?",
      "answers": [
        {"text": "`create()` is faster than `new()`.", "correct": false},
        {"text": "`create()` is the hook that allows the factory to intercept the object creation request and apply an override if one exists.", "correct": true},
        {"text": "`new()` does not automatically call the parent class constructor.", "correct": false},
        {"text": "`create()` automatically registers the class with the factory.", "correct": false}
      ],
      "explanation": "The factory can only substitute a type if it is involved in the creation process. Using `factory.create()` gives the factory the control it needs to perform the substitution."
    },

        {"text": "report_phase", "correct": false}
      ],
      "explanation": "The `build_phase` executes top-down, ensuring that parent components are created before their children, which is the logical order for construction."
