  ## Level 1: The Big Idea
  *IEEE 1800-2023, Clause 19.7: Covergroup options*

  Coverage points only help if they sample at the right moment. SystemVerilog covergroups provide **options** to control when sampling happens and how results are reported.

  **The Analogy:** A covergroup is like a camera. Sampling options decide when the shutter clicks and how the photos are cataloged.

  ## Level 2: Practical Usage

  ### Automatic vs. Manual Sampling

  -   Define an event to sample automatically: `covergroup cg @(posedge clk);`
  -   Call `cg.sample()` manually when your monitor observes a transaction. See the [analysis components](/curriculum/T2_Intermediate/I-UVM-2_Building_TB/index#monitors-scoreboards-and-the-analysis-fabric) section for how monitors publish transactions through analysis ports.

  ### Useful Options

  | Setting | Applies to | Why you use it |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `option.per_instance` | Covergroup instance | Keep coverage per agent, channel, or configuration. |
  | `option.goal` | Covergroup instance | Define completion targets (e.g., 90%) for dashboards and regressions. |
  | `option.comment` | Covergroup instance | Tag requirements or Jira IDs next to the data. |
  | `option.weight` | Covergroup instance | Make high-value coverage count more in aggregate metrics. |
  | `type_option.merge_instances` | Covergroup type | Merge per-instance data when you want a global view. |
  | `type_option.auto_bin_max` | Coverpoint | Clamp auto bin creation so reports stay readable. |
  | `option.at_least` | Coverpoint / cross | Require each bin to hit N times before counting as covered. |

  <InteractiveCode>
  ```systemverilog
  covergroup cg_pkt @(posedge clk);
    option.per_instance = 1;
    option.goal = 90;
    option.weight = 2;
    option.comment = "VP-3.1";
    type_option.auto_bin_max = 16;

    cp_kind: coverpoint pkt.kind iff pkt.valid;
    cp_len: coverpoint pkt.length {
      bins small[] = {[0:63]};
      bins large[] = {[64:255]};
      option.at_least = 3;
    }
  endgroup

  initial begin
    cg_pkt cov = new;
    // Manual sampling example
    @(posedge clk);
    cov.sample();
  end
  ```
  </InteractiveCode>

  ## Level 3: Expert Insights

  **Gating and Conditional Sampling:** Use `iff` guards (as in the example above) or call `cov.sample()` only when transactions are valid—otherwise you dilute your metrics with idle cycles.

  **Per-Instance vs. Merge:** Keep `option.per_instance = 1` for insight, but remember you can enable `cg_pkt.type_option.merge_instances = 1;` during reporting if you need a global roll-up.

  **Runtime Introspection:** Query `cov.get_inst_coverage()` or `cov.find()` to build live dashboards, and use `set_inst_name()` so reports align with DUT hierarchy.

  **Coverage Closure Loop:** Feed uncovered bins back into constraint randomization (see [Constrained Randomization](/curriculum/T2_Intermediate/I-SV-2_Constrained_Randomization)) or targeted sequences until `option.goal` is satisfied.

  ## Quiz

  <Quiz questions={[
    {
      question: "Which option allows each instance of a covergroup to maintain its own coverage results?",
      answers: [
        { text: "`option.per_instance`", correct: true },
        { text: "`option.goal`", correct: false },
        { text: "`option.weight`", correct: false },
        { text: "`option.comment`", correct: false }
      ],
      explanation: "`option.per_instance` ensures coverage is tracked separately for each covergroup instance."
