  ## Elevator Pitch

  Assertions catch bugs by checking that design behavior meets expectations. **Immediate** assertions fire instantly within procedural code, while **concurrent** assertions monitor signal relationships over time.

  ## Practical Explanation

  ```systemverilog
  // Immediate assertion: procedural
  always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
    assert (req == 0) else $error("Req high during reset");
  end

  // Concurrent assertion: temporal
  property hold_until_ack;
    req |-> ##[1:3] ack;
  endproperty
  assert property (hold_until_ack);
  ```

  Immediate assertions live in <Link href="/curriculum/T1_Foundational/F3_Procedural_Constructs/flow-control">procedural blocks</Link>. Concurrent assertions sit outside and observe signal sequences, enabling checks like "req must be followed by ack within 3 cycles." See <Link href="/curriculum/T2_Intermediate/I-SV-4_Assertions_SVA/multi-clocking">multi-clocking</Link> for multi-clock properties.

  ## Advanced Notes

  * Concurrent assertions support sampling with `##` delays and repetition operators.
  * Use `disable iff` to mask assertions during reset.
  * Remember: **Immediate = instant; Concurrent = temporal watchdog**.
