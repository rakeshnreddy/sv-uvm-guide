## Quick Take
- **What it is:** SystemVerilog runs many concurrent threads (`initial`, `always`, `fork...join`). To make them talk to each other without race conditions, we use events (for signaling), mailboxes (for passing data), and semaphores (for sharing resources).
- **Why it matters:** As testbenches scale up, you will have dozens of components acting simultaneously. Without proper synchronization, you will experience non-deterministic simulation hangs or data corruption.
