## Quick Take
- **What it is:** The next level of SystemVerilog constrained randomization, moving beyond basic `<` and `>` into conditional constraints, iterative constraints (`foreach`), and state-space pruning control (`solve before`).
- **Why it matters:** Real-world protocols aren't just "address must be < 100". They involve dependent rules ("if it's a burst write, then the size must match the length"). You need advanced tools to model this.
