## Quick Take
- **What it is:** Advanced sequencing involves orchestrating multiple interface agents, injecting priority-based stimulus, interrupting flows, and layering protocols (e.g., TCP over IP over Ethernet).
- **Why it matters:** As testbenches scale from blocks to SoCs, keeping stimulus coordinate and maintainable requires advanced techniques beyond simple `uvm_do` loops.

### Virtual Sequences vs Virtual Sequencers

A **virtual sequence** is a sequence that controls other sequences across multiple agents. It does not generate data items for a driver itself; instead, it starts sub-sequences on subordinate sequencers. 

A **virtual sequencer** used to be the primary way to route these handles, but modern UVM often uses configuration databases (`uvm_config_db`) or object handles directly inside the virtual sequence to access the underlying agent sequencers. See the subpages for architectural examples!

## Practice & Reinforce
- Utilize the sandbox environments provided in the individual modules (like the [Sequencer Arbitration sandbox](/exercises/sequencer-arbitration)) to see how locks, grabs, and priorities interact under the hood.
