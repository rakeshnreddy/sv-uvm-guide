## The "Why" of Sequences

In UVM, we don't write stimulus inside the testcase itself. Instead, we encapsulate test intent into **sequences**. A sequence is a `uvm_object` that contains the logic to generate a stream of related `uvm_sequence_item`s (transactions).

Why this extra layer of abstraction?
-   **Reusability:** A sequence like `write_all_registers` can be reused across dozens of tests.
-   **Decoupling:** Sequences are completely decoupled from the physical driver. A sequence defines *what* to send, while the driver handles *how* to send it. This means you can run the same sequence on different agents with different driver implementations.
-   **Layering:** You can build complex scenarios by creating sequences that call other, simpler sequences.

Sequences are the "brains" of the test. They represent the actual test intent.

## The Sequence/Driver Handshake

The communication between the sequence, sequencer, and driver is fundamental. Let's visualize the blocking handshake that occurs when `uvm_do` is called.

<AnimatedUvmSequenceDriverHandshakeDiagram />

1.  **`driver.get_next_item(req)`**: The driver requests the next item from the sequencer. This call blocks until an item is available from a sequence.
2.  **`start_item(item)`**: The sequence sends the transaction to the sequencer. The sequencer places it in its FIFO and grants access to the driver. The `start_item` call is *blocking* and does not return until the driver calls `get_next_item()`.
3.  **Driver executes**: The driver receives the transaction and has exclusive access to drive it.
4.  **`finish_item(item)`**: The sequence call returns. The transaction has been sent to the driver.
5.  **`driver.item_done()`**: The driver signals that it has finished with the current item and is ready for the next one. **This is the step that unblocks the sequencer to allow the next transaction.**

### Your First Sequence: Generating a Single Transaction

A sequence must be extended from `uvm_sequence` and implement the `body()` task. The `body()` task contains the logic for generating transactions. The `uvm_do` family of macros is the standard way to create, randomize, and send a transaction to the driver.

<InteractiveCode>
```systemverilog
// The transaction (sequence item)
class my_transaction extends uvm_sequence_item;
  rand int data;
  `uvm_object_utils_begin(my_transaction)
    `uvm_field_int(data, UVM_DEFAULT)
  `uvm_object_utils_end
  function new(string name = "my_transaction"); super.new(name); endfunction
endclass

// The sequence that generates the transactions
class my_simple_sequence extends uvm_sequence #(my_transaction);
  `uvm_object_utils(my_simple_sequence)
  function new(string name = "my_simple_sequence"); super.new(name); endfunction

  virtual task body();
    my_transaction req;
    // Send 5 transactions
    repeat (5) begin
      // The uvm_do macro is a shortcut for create, randomize, and send
      `uvm_do(req)
    end
  endtask
endclass

// The driver that executes the transactions
class my_driver extends uvm_driver #(my_transaction);
  `uvm_component_utils(my_driver)
  // ... constructor ...
  virtual task run_phase(uvm_phase phase);
    forever begin
      // 1. Get the next item from the sequencer
      seq_item_port.get_next_item(req);

      // 2. Drive the transaction to the DUT
      `uvm_info("DRIVER", $sformatf("Driving transaction: %s", req.sprint()), UVM_MEDIUM)
      #10; // Simulate driving time

      // 3. Indicate completion to the sequencer
      seq_item_port.item_done();
    end
  endtask
endclass

// In a test, you would start the sequence on the agent's sequencer:
// my_simple_sequence_inst.start(env.agent.sequencer);
```
</InteractiveCode>

This example registers the default sequence using <Link href="/curriculum/T2_Intermediate/I-UVM-3_Sequences/uvm-config-db">uvm_config_db</Link> so the sequencer can retrieve it at runtime.

### Procedural Sequences

The `body()` task is a regular SystemVerilog task, so you can use loops, conditionals, and other procedural constructs to create complex stimulus.

```systemverilog
class my_burst_sequence extends uvm_sequence#(my_item);
  `uvm_object_utils(my_burst_sequence)
  // ... constructor ...

  task body();
    `uvm_info(get_type_name(), "Starting burst sequence", UVM_LOW)
    // Send a burst of 10 transactions
    repeat (10) begin
      `uvm_do_with(req, {
        // Constrain the address for this specific transaction
        req.addr == 8'h40 + i;
      })
    end
    `uvm_info(get_type_name(), "Finished burst sequence", UVM_LOW)
  endtask
endclass
```

## Analysis Components

Analysis components are the "eyes and ears" of your testbench. They observe the behavior of the DUT and check that it is correct.

### The Monitor

The monitor is a passive component that observes the DUT's interface and captures transactions. It should never drive any signals.

### The Scoreboard

The scoreboard is a checker component that compares the actual results from the DUT with the expected results.

<InteractiveCode>
```systemverilog
// A monitor that observes transactions and broadcasts them
class my_monitor extends uvm_monitor;
  `uvm_component_utils(my_monitor)
  uvm_analysis_port #(my_transaction) ap;

  function new(string name="my_monitor", uvm_component parent=null);
    super.new(name,parent);
    ap = new("ap", this);
  endfunction

  virtual task run_phase(uvm_phase phase);
    // ... capture bus activity and create a transaction 'tr' ...
    ap.write(tr);
  endtask
endclass

// A scoreboard that subscribes to the monitor's analysis port
class my_scoreboard extends uvm_scoreboard;
  `uvm_component_utils(my_scoreboard)
  uvm_analysis_imp #(my_transaction, my_scoreboard) analysis_export;

  function new(string name="my_scoreboard", uvm_component parent=null);
    super.new(name,parent);
    analysis_export = new("analysis_export", this);
  endfunction

  function void write(my_transaction tr);
    // ... scoreboard checking logic ...
  endfunction
endclass
```
</InteractiveCode>

## Key Takeaways

-   **Sequences** represent the *intent* of a test and are the primary mechanism for stimulus generation in UVM.
-   They are decoupled from the driver, enabling high reusability.
-   The `uvm_do` family of macros is the standard way to generate and send a single transaction.
-   The **sequence/sequencer/driver handshake** is a critical blocking protocol that you must understand to debug testbench hangs.
-   **Layering sequences** allows you to build complex scenarios from simple, reusable building blocks.

## Quiz

<Quiz questions={[
    {
      "question": "A sequence needs to send a critical, uninterrupted burst of 5 transactions to program a mode register. Which mechanism should it use?",
      "answers": [
        {"text": "A `for` loop with `uvm_do`", "correct": false},
        {"text": "`lock()` before the burst and `unlock()` after", "correct": true},
        {"text": "Using `p_sequencer`", "correct": false},
        {"text": "Calling `get_next_item()` directly", "correct": false}
      ],
      "explanation": "`lock()` ensures that no other sequence can send transactions to the driver, guaranteeing that the 5-transaction burst is sent atomically without interruption."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary purpose of the `item_done()` call in the driver?",
      "answers": [
        {"text": "To tell the scoreboard that the transaction is complete.", "correct": false},
        {"text": "To log the transaction to a file.", "correct": false},
        {"text": "To signal to the sequencer that the driver is finished with the current transaction and is ready for the next one.", "correct": true},
        {"text": "To return the transaction to the sequence.", "correct": false}
      ],
      "explanation": "Forgetting to call `item_done()` is a very common bug. It prevents the sequencer from unblocking and sending the next transaction, causing the testbench to hang."
