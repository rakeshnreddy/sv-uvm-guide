## The "Why" of Sequences

In UVM, we don't write stimulus inside the testcase itself. Instead, we encapsulate test intent into **sequences**. A sequence is a `uvm_object` that contains the logic to generate a stream of related `uvm_sequence_item`s (transactions).

Why this extra layer of abstraction?
-   **Reusability:** A sequence like `write_all_registers` can be reused across dozens of tests.
-   **Decoupling:** Sequences are completely decoupled from the physical driver. A sequence defines *what* to send, while the driver handles *how* to send it. This means you can run the same sequence on different agents with different driver implementations.
-   **Layering:** You can build complex scenarios by creating sequences that call other, simpler sequences.

Sequences are the "brains" of the test. They represent the actual test intent.

## Level 1/2: Practical Sequence Creation

### Your First Sequence: Generating a Single Transaction

A sequence must be extended from `uvm_sequence` and implement the `body()` task. The `body()` task contains the logic for generating transactions. The `uvm_do` family of macros is the standard way to create, randomize, and send a transaction to the driver.

<InteractiveCode>
```systemverilog
// The transaction (sequence item)
class my_transaction extends uvm_sequence_item;
  rand int data;
  `uvm_object_utils_begin(my_transaction)
    `uvm_field_int(data, UVM_DEFAULT)
  `uvm_object_utils_end
  function new(string name = "my_transaction"); super.new(name); endfunction
endclass

// The sequence that generates the transactions
class my_simple_sequence extends uvm_sequence #(my_transaction);
  `uvm_object_utils(my_simple_sequence)
  function new(string name = "my_simple_sequence"); super.new(name); endfunction

  virtual task body();
    my_transaction req;
    // Send 5 transactions
    repeat (5) begin
      // The uvm_do macro is a shortcut for create, randomize, and send
      `uvm_do(req)
    end
  endtask
endclass

// The driver that executes the transactions
class my_driver extends uvm_driver #(my_transaction);
  `uvm_component_utils(my_driver)
  // ... constructor ...
  virtual task run_phase(uvm_phase phase);
    forever begin
      // 1. Get the next item from the sequencer
      seq_item_port.get_next_item(req);

      // 2. Drive the transaction to the DUT
      `uvm_info("DRIVER", $sformatf("Driving transaction: %s", req.sprint()), UVM_MEDIUM)
      #10; // Simulate driving time

      // 3. Indicate completion to the sequencer
      seq_item_port.item_done();
    end
  endtask
endclass

// In a test, you would start the sequence on the agent's sequencer:
// my_simple_sequence_inst.start(env.agent.sequencer);
```
</InteractiveCode>

This example registers the default sequence using <Link href="/curriculum/T2_Intermediate/I-UVM-3_Sequences/uvm-config-db">uvm_config_db</Link> so the sequencer can retrieve it at runtime.

### Procedural Sequences

The `body()` task is a regular SystemVerilog task, so you can use loops, conditionals, and other procedural constructs to create complex stimulus.

```systemverilog
class my_burst_sequence extends uvm_sequence#(my_item);
  `uvm_object_utils(my_burst_sequence)
  // ... constructor ...

  task body();
    `uvm_info(get_type_name(), "Starting burst sequence", UVM_LOW)
    // Send a burst of 10 transactions
    repeat (10) begin
      `uvm_do_with(req, {
        // Constrain the address for this specific transaction
        req.addr == 8'h40 + i;
      })
    end
    `uvm_info(get_type_name(), "Finished burst sequence", UVM_LOW)
  endtask
endclass
```

### The Handshake In-Depth

The communication between the sequence, sequencer, and driver is fundamental. Let's visualize the blocking handshake that occurs when `uvm_do` is called.

<AnimatedUvmSequenceDriverHandshakeDiagram />

1.  **`start_item(item)`**: The sequence sends the transaction to the sequencer. The sequencer places it in its FIFO and grants access to the driver. The `start_item` call is *blocking* and does not return until the driver calls `get_next_item()`.
2.  **`driver.get_next_item(req)`**: The driver requests the next item from the sequencer. This call blocks until an item is available from a sequence.
3.  **Driver executes**: The driver receives the transaction and has exclusive access to drive it.
4.  **`finish_item(item)`**: The sequence call returns. The transaction has been sent to the driver.
5.  **`driver.item_done()`**: The driver signals that it has finished with the current item and is ready for the next one. **This is the step that unblocks the sequencer to allow the next transaction.**

## Level 3: Expert Insight

### Sequence Layering

The real power of sequences comes from layering. A high-level sequence can execute other, lower-level sequences. This allows you to build a library of reusable stimulus building blocks.

```systemverilog
class my_super_sequence extends uvm_sequence#(my_item);
  // ... utils and constructor ...
  rand read_sequence  read_seq;
  rand write_sequence write_seq;

  task body();
    // Execute a sequence of other sequences
    `uvm_do(read_seq)
    `uvm_do(write_seq)
    `uvm_do(read_seq)
  endtask
endclass
```

### The `p_sequencer` Handle

A sequence often needs to access information from the agent it's running in (e.g., a configuration object). The `p_sequencer` is a generic handle to the sequencer the sequence is running on. You should cast it to your specific sequencer type to access its contents.

```systemverilog
// In the sequence body() task:
my_sequencer_t my_sqr;
if (!$cast(my_sqr, m_sequencer)) `uvm_fatal(...)
// Now you can access things in your sequencer
if (my_sqr.config.is_dma_enabled) begin ... end
```

### Grabbing and Locking

Sometimes a sequence needs to send a critical series of transactions without being interrupted by other sequences.
-   **`lock(sequencer)`**: Grants this sequence exclusive access to the driver. No other sequences can send transactions until this sequence calls `unlock()`.
-   **`grab(sequencer)`**: A more aggressive version of `lock` that will immediately take control, even if another sequence is currently locked.

### Sequence Libraries

For a regression, you don't want to run one test at a time. You create a "sequence library" â€“ a collection of all your different test sequences. You can then configure the sequencer to simply pick and run sequences from this library at random, which is a very effective way to find unexpected bugs.

## Key Takeaways

-   **Sequences** represent the *intent* of a test and are the primary mechanism for stimulus generation in UVM.
-   They are decoupled from the driver, enabling high reusability.
-   The `uvm_do` family of macros is the standard way to generate and send a single transaction.
-   The **sequence/sequencer/driver handshake** is a critical blocking protocol that you must understand to debug testbench hangs.
-   **Layering sequences** allows you to build complex scenarios from simple, reusable building blocks.
