## The "Why" of Advanced Factory Usage

Simple type overrides are powerful, but the UVM factory offers more granular control. What if you want to replace a driver in only *one* specific agent? What if you need to debug why an override isn't working? Advanced factory usage gives you the tools to handle these complex scenarios.

## Level 1: The Targeted Swap

Imagine a car factory that produces cars for both the US and the UK. The assembly line is the same, but for the UK cars, you need to install the steering wheel on the right side. You don't want to change the steering wheel for all cars, just the ones going to the UK. This is like an **instance override**: targeting a specific instance for a change, rather than all instances of a type.

## Level 2: Core Mechanics

### Instance Overrides

An instance override replaces a component or object at a specific hierarchical path. This is useful for targeting a change to a specific part of the testbench.

<InteractiveCode>
```systemverilog
// In the test's build_phase:

// This will override the 'my_driver' instance inside the 'agent1' instance
// with the 'error_driver' type.
factory.set_inst_override_by_type("env.agent1.driver",
                                  my_driver::get_type(),
                                  error_driver::get_type());
```
</InteractiveCode>

### String-Based Overrides

You can also use strings to specify the types for overrides. This is less safe than using `get_type()` because it's not checked at compile time, but it can be useful for scripting and command-line overrides.

<InteractiveCode>
```systemverilog
// In the test's build_phase:
factory.set_type_override_by_name("my_driver", "error_driver");
```
</InteractiveCode>

### Debugging the Factory

When an override doesn't work as expected, the `print()` method is your best friend.

<InteractiveCode>
```systemverilog
// In the test's end_of_elaboration_phase:
factory.print();
```
</InteractiveCode>

This will print a detailed report of all the factory's registered types, overrides, and instance overrides.

## Level 3: Expert Insights

**Factory Verbosity:** You can control the amount of information the factory prints using `uvm_top.set_report_verbosity_level_hier(UVM_FULL)`.

**Parameterized Classes:** The factory has limited support for parameterized classes. It's often better to use a wrapper class or a different approach when dealing with parameterized classes and factory overrides.

**Memory & Retention Tip:** Remember: **Instance Override = Specific Target.** **String Override = Flexible but Risky.** **`factory.print()` = Your Debugging Superpower.**

      ],
      "explanation": "Using `get_type()` is much safer because the compiler will catch any typos in the class names. String-based overrides are not checked until runtime."
