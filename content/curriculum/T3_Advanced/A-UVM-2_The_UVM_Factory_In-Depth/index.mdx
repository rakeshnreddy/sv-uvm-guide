## The "Why" of Advanced Factory Usage

Simple type overrides are powerful, but the UVM factory offers more granular control. What if you want to replace a driver in only *one* specific agent? What if you need to debug why an override isn't working? Advanced factory usage gives you the tools to handle these complex scenarios.

## Level 1: The Targeted Swap

Imagine a car factory that produces cars for both the US and the UK. The assembly line is the same, but for the UK cars, you need to install the steering wheel on the right side. You don't want to change the steering wheel for all cars, just the ones going to the UK. This is like an **instance override**: targeting a specific instance for a change, rather than all instances of a type.

## Level 2: Core Mechanics

### Instance Overrides

An instance override replaces a component or object at a specific hierarchical path. This is useful for targeting a change to a specific part of the testbench.

<InteractiveCode>
```systemverilog
// In the test's build_phase:

// This will override the 'my_driver' instance inside the 'agent1' instance
// with the 'error_driver' type.
factory.set_inst_override_by_type("env.agent1.driver",
                                  my_driver::get_type(),
                                  error_driver::get_type());
```
</InteractiveCode>

### String-Based Overrides

You can also use strings to specify the types for overrides. This is less safe than using `get_type()` because it's not checked at compile time, but it can be useful for scripting and command-line overrides.

<InteractiveCode>
```systemverilog
// In the test's build_phase:
factory.set_type_override_by_name("my_driver", "error_driver");
```
</InteractiveCode>

### Architectural Pattern: The Configurable Agent

A powerful use of the factory is to create an agent that can be easily configured to be active or passive. This is a cornerstone of vertical reuse, allowing you to reuse the same agent at the block level (as an active driver) and at the SoC level (as a passive monitor).

<InteractiveCode
  language="systemverilog"
  fileName="configurable_agent.sv"
  code={`
// The agent's build_phase
function void my_agent::build_phase(uvm_phase phase);
  super.build_phase(phase);
  // By default, create a passive monitor
  m_monitor = my_monitor::type_id::create("m_monitor", this);

  if (is_active == UVM_ACTIVE) begin
    // If the agent is active, also create the driver and sequencer
    m_driver    = my_driver::type_id::create("m_driver", this);
    m_sequencer = my_sequencer::type_id::create("m_sequencer", this);
  end
endfunction

// In a base test (passive monitoring)
// No overrides needed, the agent is passive by default.

// In a block-level test (active stimulus)
class block_test extends base_test;
  `uvm_component_utils(block_test)
  function void build_phase(uvm_phase phase);
    super.build_phase(phase);
    // Override the agent to be active
    factory.set_type_override_by_name("my_agent", "my_active_agent");
  endfunction
endclass

// Where `my_active_agent` is just an extension of `my_agent`
// that sets `is_active = UVM_ACTIVE` in its constructor.
  `}
  explanationSteps={[
    { target: "2-11", title: "The Configurable Agent", explanation: "The agent's `build_phase` first creates the monitor, which is always needed. It then checks the `is_active` flag. Only if the agent is `UVM_ACTIVE` does it create the driver and sequencer. This is the key pattern." },
    { target: "19-26", title: "The Active Test", explanation: "In a test where we need the agent to be active, we don't change the agent's code. Instead, we use a factory override to replace the default `my_agent` with an `my_active_agent`." },
    { target: "28-29", title: "The Active Agent Wrapper", explanation: "`my_active_agent` is an empty wrapper around `my_agent`. Its only purpose is to call its parent constructor and set the `is_active` flag to `UVM_ACTIVE`. The factory override swaps in this version, which then builds the driver and sequencer. This is a clean, non-intrusive way to control the agent's topology." }

### Debugging the Factory

When an override doesn't work as expected, the `print()` method is your best friend.

<InteractiveCode>
```systemverilog
// In the test's end_of_elaboration_phase:
factory.print();
```
</InteractiveCode>

This will print a detailed report of all the factory's registered types, overrides, and instance overrides.

## Level 3: Methodology & Strategy

### Methodology Customization with the Factory

The factory is the primary mechanism for customizing and extending a verification methodology without modifying the original source code.

- **Creating Custom Component Base Classes:** A common practice in large companies is to create a custom base class for all components (e.g., `my_company_driver extends uvm_driver`). This custom class can contain company-specific additions, such as hooks for a proprietary reporting or debug system. To ensure all drivers in the environment use this new base class, you can set a global factory override in your base test:
  `factory.set_type_override_by_name("uvm_driver", "my_company_driver");`

- **Swapping in Protocol-Specific Checkers:** Imagine a generic bus scoreboard. For an AHB bus, you want it to use an `ahb_checker`. For an AXI bus, you want an `axi_checker`. You can create your scoreboard to contain a generic `uvm_component` called `m_checker`. Then, in your AHB environment, you use the factory to override `m_checker` with the `ahb_checker`. In the AXI environment, you override it with the `axi_checker`. This makes the scoreboard highly reusable.

### Leadership: Planning a Factory Strategy

As a verification lead or architect, how you manage the factory is a critical policy decision.
- **Centralized vs. Decentralized Overrides:** Do you allow every test writer to set their own overrides, or do you have a centralized file or base test that controls all overrides?
  - **Centralized (Recommended):** A centralized approach (e.g., in a `test_library`'s `build_phase`) is more maintainable and predictable. It provides a single place to look to understand the environment's configuration.
  - **Decentralized:** Allowing overrides in individual tests can lead to chaos. A test might pass or fail depending on a "hidden" override deep in the test file, making regression debug very difficult.

- **Policy on String-Based Overrides:** Do you allow them? A good policy is to **ban string-based overrides in all RTL-level testbenches**. They are acceptable for scripting or top-level testbenches where flexibility is key, but for reusable VIP, the compile-time safety of `get_type()` overrides is essential.

## Level 4: Architect's Corner

### Advanced Factory Usage: The "Abstract Agent" Pattern

**The Challenge:** You need to create a piece of Verification IP (VIP) for a standard bus protocol, like AXI. This VIP will be used by many different teams in your company, and each team might have slightly different needs. Team A needs a simple AXI4-Lite agent. Team B needs a full AXI4 agent with burst support. Team C needs an AXI-Stream agent.

**The Anti-Pattern:** Creating three separate, monolithic agents (`axi_lite_agent`, `axi4_agent`, `axi_stream_agent`). This leads to massive code duplication and a maintenance nightmare.

**The Architectural Pattern:**

1.  **Create an Abstract Base Agent (`axi_base_agent`):** This agent contains all the common elements: a virtual interface handle, an `is_active` flag, and a `uvm_analysis_port`. However, its `build_phase` and `connect_phase` are **empty virtual methods**. It cannot be constructed directly.

2.  **Create Concrete Component Classes:** Create different driver and monitor classes for each protocol variant (e.g., `axi_lite_driver`, `axi4_driver`, `axi_stream_driver`).

3.  **Create Concrete Agent Implementations:** Create specific agent classes that extend the abstract base agent (e.g., `class axi4_agent extends axi_base_agent`). In the `build_phase` of this concrete agent, you use the factory to construct the specific components you need (`m_driver = axi4_driver::type_id::create(...)`).

4.  **Use the Factory in the Environment:** The environment is built to contain the *abstract* `axi_base_agent`.
    ```systemverilog
    class my_env extends uvm_env;
      axi_base_agent m_agent; // Contains the abstract agent
      //...
      function void build_phase(uvm_phase phase);
        // The factory creates the agent
        m_agent = axi_base_agent::type_id::create("m_agent", this);
      endfunction
    endclass
    ```

5.  **Control Everything from the Test:** In a test, you use a single factory override to select the desired agent "personality":
    ```systemverilog
    // Test for AXI4-Lite
    factory.set_type_override_by_type(axi_base_agent::get_type(), axi_lite_agent::get_type());
    ```
    This single line of code tells the factory, "Whenever someone tries to create an `axi_base_agent`, create an `axi_lite_agent` instead." The `axi_lite_agent` then populates itself with the correct driver and monitor.

**The Outcome:** This pattern provides the ultimate in reusability and configurability. The environment is completely generic. All the protocol-specific details are encapsulated in the concrete agent classes, and the choice of which protocol to use is controlled by a single, clean factory override in the test. This is a hallmark of a professional, architect-level UVM environment.
