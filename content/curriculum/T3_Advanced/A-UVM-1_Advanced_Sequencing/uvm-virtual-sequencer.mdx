# UVM Virtual Sequencer

The UVM Virtual Sequencer is a key component for building sophisticated, multi-agent testbenches. It acts as a master controller, enabling the synchronization of stimulus across different interfaces of the DUT.

## The Concept

A virtual sequencer does not connect to a driver. Instead, it contains handles to the other sequencers in the environment. A special type of sequence, a "<Link href="/curriculum/T3_Advanced/A-UVM-1_Advanced_Sequencing/virtual-sequences">virtual sequence</Link>," runs on the virtual sequencer. This virtual sequence can then start sequences on the agent-specific sequencers, allowing for coordinated stimulus generation.

The diagram on the page illustrates this concept, showing a virtual sequencer controlling PCIe and Ethernet sequencers.

## Implementation

The implementation involves two main parts:

1.  **The Virtual Sequencer:** A `uvm_sequencer` that contains handles to the agent sequencers.
2.  **The Virtual Sequence:** A `uvm_sequence` that runs on the virtual sequencer and starts sequences on the agent sequencers.

The interactive code block on the page provides a detailed walkthrough of a sample implementation. By studying the code and the explanations, you can understand how to implement a virtual sequencer and a virtual sequence in your own testbench.
