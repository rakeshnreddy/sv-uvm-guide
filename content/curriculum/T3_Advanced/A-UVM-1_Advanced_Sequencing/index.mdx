## The "Why" of Advanced Sequencing

Simple, single sequences are great for basic tests, but real-world verification requires more complex and coordinated stimulus. Advanced sequencing techniques provide the tools to build sophisticated, reusable, and maintainable stimulus scenarios.

## Level 1: The Screenplay Analogy

- **Simple Sequence:** A single scene in a movie.
- **Layered Sequence:** A sequence that calls other sequences, like a scene that is made up of smaller sub-scenes.
- **Virtual Sequence:** The master screenplay for the entire movie, coordinating all the different actors (agents) and scenes.
- **Sequence Library:** A collection of all the different screenplays (sequences) that can be used to create different movies (tests).

## Level 2: Architectural Pattern: The Virtual Sequence

The most common and powerful advanced sequencing pattern is the **virtual sequence**. A virtual sequence does not generate transactions itself. Instead, its purpose is to *coordinate* other sequences that are running on different sequencers in the testbench. It acts as the "master conductor" of the test.

This is a critical pattern for SoC-level verification, where you need to synchronize stimulus across multiple interfaces (e.g., "configure the CPU core via its instruction bus, then have the Ethernet MAC send a packet").

#### Interactive Example: Coordinating Two Agents

In this example, a virtual sequence (`virtual_test_seq`) will coordinate two agents: a `config_agent` (perhaps for setting up registers) and a `data_agent` (for sending main bus traffic).

  fileName="virtual_sequence_example.sv"

// High-level virtual sequence
class virtual_test_seq extends uvm_sequence;
  `uvm_object_utils(virtual_test_seq)

  // Handles to the target sequencers
  config_sequencer_h config_sqr;
  data_sequencer_h   data_sqr;

  task body();
    // 1. Create the sub-sequences
    config_dut_seq  config_seq = config_dut_seq::type_id::create("config_seq");
    data_xfer_seq   data_seq   = data_xfer_seq::type_id::create("data_seq");

    // 2. Start the configuration sequence on the config sequencer
    config_seq.start(config_sqr);

    // 3. Wait for the DUT to be configured (could be an event or delay)
    #100ns;

    // 4. Start the data transfer sequence on the data sequencer
    data_seq.start(data_sqr);
  endtask
endclass

// In the test, we connect the sequencer handles
class my_test extends uvm_test;
  // ...
  function void connect_phase(uvm_phase phase);
    // Get the handles from the config DB
    uvm_config_db#(virtual uvm_sequencer_base)::get(this, "", "env.config_agent.sequencer", v_sqr.config_sqr);
    uvm_config_db#(virtual uvm_sequencer_base)::get(this, "", "env.data_agent.sequencer", v_sqr.data_sqr);
  endfunction

    { target: "2-19", title: "The Virtual Sequence", explanation: "This sequence extends `uvm_sequence`, but it does not have an item type. Its only job is to control other sequences. It contains handles to the 'real' sequencers it needs to control." },

    { target: "18", title: "Starting the Second Sub-sequence", explanation: "After some coordination delay, the virtual sequence starts the `data_seq` on the `data_agent`'s sequencer. This demonstrates the core power of virtual sequences: creating coordinated, multi-interface stimulus." },

This 'late binding' makes the virtual sequence highly reusable." }

## Level 3: Architectural Patterns & Debug

### Architectural Pattern: Layered Sequence Libraries for Reuse

A key goal of a mature verification environment is reusability. A powerful pattern to achieve this is to combine layered sequences with sequence libraries.

1.  **Base Layer (Atomic Sequences):** Create a library of very simple sequences, each performing a single, atomic action (e.g., `write_one_reg_seq`, `read_one_reg_seq`, `send_one_packet_seq`). These are the fundamental building blocks.
2.  **Mid Layer (Scenario Sequences):** Create sequences that combine atomic sequences to perform a meaningful task (e.g., `configure_dma_seq` which calls `write_one_reg_seq` multiple times, or `send_burst_seq` which calls `send_one_packet_seq` in a loop).
3.  **High Layer (Test-Level Sequences):** These are the sequences you would typically call from a virtual sequence. They combine mid-layer sequences to create a complete test scenario (e.g., `dma_test_seq` which calls `configure_dma_seq` then `send_burst_seq`).

This layered approach makes your stimulus highly maintainable and reusable across different tests and even different projects.

### Debug Methodology: The UVM Command Line Processor

When you have complex, nested sequences, debugging can be a nightmare. The UVM Command Line Processor is a powerful, underutilized tool for this. You can enable it with a simulator switch (e.g., `+UVM_CMDLINE_PROC` for VCS).

Once enabled, you can interactively:
- **Set sequence priority:** `uvm_set_seq_prio <seq_path> <priority>`
- **Stop and resume sequencers:** `uvm_stop_sequencer <sequencer_path>`
- **Get a list of all running sequences:** `uvm_report_sequences`

This allows you to pause a complex simulation, inspect the state of your sequences, and manually change their priority to debug complex arbitration scenarios without needing to recompile.

### War Story: The Out-of-Order Packet

On a networking SoC, we had a test where a virtual sequence was supposed to send a control packet on one interface and then a data packet on another. The test was failing because the data packet was arriving before the control packet. The two sub-sequences were started with a simple `#10ns` delay in between. The problem was that the data agent's driver was much simpler and faster than the control agent's. The `#10ns` was not enough to guarantee ordering. **The lesson:** Never rely on fixed delays for synchronization. The virtual sequence should have used a more robust mechanism, like waiting for an event from the control agent's monitor (`control_agent.monitor.control_packet_sent.wait_on()`) before starting the data sequence. This is event-based synchronization and is the cornerstone of robust virtual sequences.

## Level 4: Architect's Corner

### Case Study: A Layered Sequence Architecture for PCIe

**The Challenge:** Verify the data link layer of a PCIe controller. This requires generating complex sequences of Transaction Layer Packets (TLPs), handling flow control (credits), and injecting errors.

**The Architecture:**

1.  **Transaction Layer (Low-Level):**
    *   A base `tlp_sequence` was created, containing a single `pcie_tlp` transaction item. This sequence had constraints for all possible TLP types (Memory Read, Memory Write, Completion, etc.).
    *   Specific sequences inherited from `tlp_sequence` to create concrete TLPs (e.g., `mem_write_32b_seq`, `cpl_with_data_seq`). This formed the atomic layer.

2.  **Data Link Layer (Mid-Level):**
    *   A `flow_control_seq` was created. It didn't send TLPs but would run in parallel to monitor the flow control credit count from the monitor and grab the sequencer to pause TLP generation if credits ran out.
    *   An `error_injection_seq` would use `uvm_do_on_the_fly` to occasionally corrupt a TLP generated by another sequence.

3.  **Test Layer (High-Level):**
    *   A virtual sequence (`pcie_test_seq`) coordinated everything. It would:
        *   `fork...join_none` the `flow_control_seq` to run constantly in the background.
        *   Randomly decide whether to also `fork...join_none` the `error_injection_seq`.
        *   Execute a primary stimulus sequence, like a series of memory writes, using the atomic TLP sequences.

**The Outcome:** This architecture was incredibly robust and reusable. For a new test, an engineer simply had to write a new high-level sequence that combined the existing mid-level and low-level blocks. Debugging was also simplified; if a TLP was malformed, the bug was in the TLP sequence layer. If TLPs were dropped, the bug was in the flow control layer. This separation of concerns is the hallmark of a well-architected sequencing strategy.
