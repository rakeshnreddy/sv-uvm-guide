## The "Why" of Advanced Sequencing

Simple, single sequences are great for basic tests, but real-world verification requires more complex and coordinated stimulus. Advanced sequencing techniques provide the tools to build sophisticated, reusable, and maintainable stimulus scenarios.

## Level 1: The Screenplay Analogy

- **Simple Sequence:** A single scene in a movie.
- **Layered Sequence:** A sequence that calls other sequences, like a scene that is made up of smaller sub-scenes.
- **Virtual Sequence:** The master screenplay for the entire movie, coordinating all the different actors (agents) and scenes.
- **Sequence Library:** A collection of all the different screenplays (sequences) that can be used to create different movies (tests).

## Level 2: Core Mechanics

### Layered Sequences

A layered sequence is a sequence that executes other sequences. This is a powerful technique for building complex scenarios from smaller, reusable building blocks.

<InteractiveCode>
```systemverilog
// A low-level sequence to write a single register
class write_reg_seq extends uvm_sequence #(my_item);
  // ...
endclass

// A mid-level sequence to configure the DUT
class config_dut_seq extends uvm_sequence #(my_item);
  `uvm_object_utils(config_dut_seq)
  // ...
  task body();
    write_reg_seq write_seq = write_reg_seq::type_id::create("write_seq");
    // Write to a series of configuration registers
    `uvm_do_with(write_seq, {addr == 8'h01; data == 8'h10;})
    `uvm_do_with(write_seq, {addr == 8'h02; data == 8'h20;})
  endtask
endclass

// A high-level sequence that configures the DUT and then runs a data transfer
class test_seq extends uvm_sequence #(my_item);
  `uvm_object_utils(test_seq)
  // ...
  task body();
    config_dut_seq config_seq = config_dut_seq::type_id::create("config_seq");
    data_transfer_seq data_seq = data_transfer_seq::type_id::create("data_seq");

    // Execute the sequences in order
    `uvm_do(config_seq)
    `uvm_do(data_seq)
  endtask
endclass
```
</InteractiveCode>

### Virtual Sequences

A virtual sequence is a sequence that runs on a virtual sequencer and coordinates the activity of multiple agents. See the "Virtual Sequences and Sequencers" topic for more details.

### Sequence Libraries

A sequence library is a collection of sequences that can be selected from at random during a test. This is a powerful technique for finding unexpected bugs.

<InteractiveCode>
```systemverilog
// In the test:
function void build_phase(uvm_phase phase);
  // ...
  uvm_sequence_library_pkg::add_type(my_seq_lib::get_type());
  <Link href="/curriculum/T2_Intermediate/I-UVM-3_Sequences/uvm-config-db">uvm_config_db</Link>#(uvm_object_wrapper)::set(this,
                                          "env.agent.sequencer.run_phase",
                                          "default_sequence",
                                          my_seq_lib::get_type());
endfunction
```
</InteractiveCode>

## Level 3: Expert Insights

**Sequence Priority and Arbitration:** The sequencer can be configured with different arbitration algorithms (e.g., `UVM_SEQ_ARB_FIFO`, `UVM_SEQ_ARB_WEIGHTED`, `UVM_SEQ_ARB_RANDOM`) to control which sequence gets to send its transactions when multiple sequences are running concurrently.

**`is_relevant()` and `wait_for_relevant()`:** These methods can be used to create reactive sequences that only run when certain conditions are met.

**Memory & Retention Tip:** Remember: **Layered Sequences = Building blocks.** **Virtual Sequences = Conductor.** **Sequence Library = Playlist.**
