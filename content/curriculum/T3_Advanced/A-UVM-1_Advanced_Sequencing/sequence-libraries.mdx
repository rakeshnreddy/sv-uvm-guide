  ## Elevator Pitch

  Sequence libraries turn curated stimulus into data. Register atomic/scenario sequences once, randomize which one runs via weights, and reserve `grab()` for emergency overrides when policy isn't enough.

  ## Building a Library

  <InteractiveCode
    language="systemverilog"
    fileName="mem_sequence_library.sv"
    code={`
`uvm_sequence_library_utils_begin(mem_vip_library)
  `uvm_sequence_library_utils_add(mem_atomic_write)
  `uvm_sequence_library_utils_add(mem_burst_program)
  `uvm_sequence_library_utils_add(mem_backdoor_check)
`uvm_sequence_library_utils_end

class mem_vip_library extends uvm_sequence_library#(mem_item);
  `uvm_object_utils(mem_vip_library)

  function new(string name = "mem_vip_library");
    super.new(name);

  endfunction

      mem_backdoor_check::type_id::set_priority(1);
    };

    repeat (num_loops) begin
      `uvm_info(get_type_name(), $sformatf("Running %s", lib.next_sequence_name()), UVM_LOW)
      lib.pick_sequence(p_sequencer);
    end
  endtask

  ## Weights, Constraints, and Coverage

  - Call `type_id::set_priority(weight)` before `pick_sequence()`; weights drive `SEQ_ARB_WEIGHTED` fairness.
  - Use `sequence_library_mode = UVM_SEQ_LIB_RANDC` to cycle through every sequence before repeating.
  - Store metadata (scenario name, error injection flags) in the library to feed regression dashboards.

  ## grab()/ungrab()—Use Sparingly

  - `grab()` gives a sequence exclusive access to the sequencer, bypassing priorities. Reserve it for debug or safety-critical overrides.
  - Always place `grab()`/`ungrab()` in `try/finally` style constructs (using fork/join or `uvm_resource_db`) so exceptions cannot leak control.
  - Prefer `lock()` or weighting before reaching for `grab()`; they keep arbitration fair.
