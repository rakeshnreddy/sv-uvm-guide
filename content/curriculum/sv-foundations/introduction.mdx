## Introduction to SystemVerilog

SystemVerilog, standardized as IEEE 1800, is a powerful hardware description and verification language (HDVL). It evolved as a successor to Verilog (IEEE 1364), significantly extending its capabilities by integrating features for both complex hardware design and sophisticated, assertion-based verification.

Historically, Verilog was primarily used for hardware design (RTL - Register Transfer Level). As design complexity grew, the need for more robust verification methodologies became critical. Standalone Hardware Verification Languages (HVLs) like Vera and e emerged. SystemVerilog aimed to unify these domains, providing a single language that could handle large-scale design, testbench development, assertions, and formal verification. It incorporates object-oriented programming, enhanced data types, and dedicated constructs for verification, making it the industry standard for modern chip design and verification workflows.

## Key Goals of this Module (SystemVerilog Foundations)

This module will lay the groundwork for understanding and utilizing SystemVerilog effectively. By the end of this module, you will:

*   **Understand Core Data Types:** Learn about SystemVerilog's rich set of data types, including `logic`, `bit`, `integer`, arrays (fixed, dynamic, associative, queues), and structures. Grasp the difference between nets (e.g., `wire`) and variables (e.g., `logic`, `reg`).
*   **Master Procedural Blocks:** Become proficient with procedural blocks like `initial`, `always`, `always_comb`, `always_ff`, and `always_latch`, understanding their execution semantics and use cases in modeling hardware behavior and testbench components.
*   **Develop Basic Testbench Constructs:** Learn to build fundamental testbench elements, including module instantiation, clock generation, applying stimulus, and observing outputs. Understand the role of program blocks and clocking blocks in creating race-free testbenches.
*   **Grasp Interface Concepts:** Be introduced to SystemVerilog interfaces for bundling signals and simplifying module connections, including the use of modports.
*   **Write Basic Assertions:** Get a first look at SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) for specifying design properties and checks.

This foundational knowledge is crucial before diving into more advanced SystemVerilog features or the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM).
