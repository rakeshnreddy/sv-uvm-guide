In SystemVerilog, literals are used to represent constant values. Understanding how to define and use them correctly is fundamental for both design and verification. Basic data types form the building blocks for representing signals and storage elements.

## Theory: Number Literals and Basic Integer Types

(Reference: IEEE 1800-2017 Standard, Clause 5: Data Types - Literals)

### Number Literals

SystemVerilog supports various ways to define numeric literals:

1.  **Unsized Literals:** These are simple decimal numbers. The simulator or synthesis tool infers their size, typically defaulting to 32 bits.
    *   Example: `123`, `'b101`, `'hFF` (Note: base specifier without size implies unsized, but its usage is less common for unsized than simply `123`).

2.  **Sized Literals:** These explicitly define the number of bits and the base. The format is `<size>'<base><value>`.
    *   `<size>`: A decimal number specifying the number of bits.
    *   `<base>`: A single character indicating the base:
        *   `'d` or `'D`: Decimal
        *   `'h` or `'H`: Hexadecimal
        *   `'b` or `'B`: Binary
        *   `'o` or `'O`: Octal
    *   `<value>`: The number in the specified base. Underscores (`_`) can be used for readability and are ignored. `x` or `X` represents an unknown value, and `z` or `Z` represents a high-impedance value.

    *   Examples:
        *   `8'd123` (8-bit decimal 123)
        *   `16'hFACE` (16-bit hexadecimal FACE)
        *   `4'b1010` (4-bit binary 1010)
        *   `12'o777` (12-bit octal 777)
        *   `8'b1100_0011` (Underscore for readability)
        *   `4'b101x` (4-bit binary with LSB unknown)

### Basic Integer Types

SystemVerilog provides several built-in integer types:

1.  **`integer`**: A 4-state signed variable, traditionally 32 bits wide (implementation-dependent, but commonly 32). It can hold values `0`, `1`, `X` (unknown), and `Z` (high-impedance).
2.  **`time`**: A 4-state unsigned variable, typically 64 bits wide, used for storing simulation time. Accessed with the `$time` system function.
3.  **`real`**: A variable that stores floating-point numbers (double-precision by default). This is primarily a simulation construct and is not synthesizable into hardware directly.
4.  **`shortint`**: A 2-state signed 16-bit integer.
5.  **`int`**: A 2-state signed 32-bit integer.
6.  **`longint`**: A 2-state signed 64-bit integer.
7.  **`byte`**: A 2-state signed 8-bit integer.
8.  **`bit`**: A 2-state unsigned single-bit data type. Can be used to declare vectors, e.g., `bit [7:0] my_2state_byte;`. 2-state types (like `bit`, `int`) are generally more performant in simulation and can be more memory efficient than 4-state types when `X` and `Z` are not needed.

(The types `logic`, `reg`, `wire` will be discussed in detail in the next section as they relate to nets and variables and 4-state values.)

## Example

Here's a `CodeBlock` demonstrating declarations and assignments of different literals and basic integer types:

```systemverilog
module literal_example;

  // Unsized decimal literal
  integer my_int_unsized = 12345;

  // Sized literals
  logic [7:0]  my_byte_bin    = 8'b0101_1010; // 8-bit binary
  logic [15:0] my_word_hex    = 16'hCAFE;    // 16-bit hexadecimal
  integer      my_int_sized   = 32'd100;     // 32-bit decimal
  logic [3:0]  my_nibble_oct  = 4'o12;       // 4-bit octal (equivalent to 4'b1010)
  logic [3:0]  unknown_val    = 4'b1xx0;     // Contains unknown bits

  // Basic integer types
  integer      count          = 0;
  time         current_sim_time;
  real         voltage_level  = 1.25;
  int          fast_counter   = -5; // 2-state signed 32-bit
  bit  [7:0]   flags          = 8'b1100_0000; // 2-state 8-bit vector

  initial begin
    current_sim_time = $time;
    $display("Time: %0t, Unsized Int: %d, Byte: %b, Word: %h", current_sim_time, my_int_unsized, my_byte_bin, my_word_hex);
    $display("Sized Int: %d, Nibble (oct): %o, Unknown: %b", my_int_sized, my_nibble_oct, unknown_val);
    $display("Count: %d, Voltage: %f, Fast Counter: %d, Flags: %b", count, voltage_level, fast_counter, flags);

    // Example of potential truncation with unsized literals if not careful
    logic [3:0] small_vec;
    small_vec = 'hF2; // Unsized hex literal 'hF2 (242 decimal) will be truncated to 4 bits
    $display("Truncated small_vec from 'hF2: %h (binary %b)", small_vec, small_vec); // Will display 'h2 (binary 0010)

    // Using sized literal prevents this
    small_vec = 4'h2;
    $display("Correct small_vec with 4'h2: %h (binary %b)", small_vec, small_vec); // Will display 'h2 (binary 0010)

  end

endmodule
```

## Best Practices

*   **Always Use Sized Literals for Assignments:** When assigning values to signals or variables, especially those with a defined bit-width, always use sized literals (e.g., `8'hFA` instead of `'hFA`). This avoids ambiguity, prevents accidental truncation or unexpected extension, and makes the code clearer about intent.
*   **Clarity with Base Specifiers:** While `'d` is often optional for decimal numbers, explicitly using base specifiers (`'b`, `'h`, `'o`) improves code readability, especially for non-decimal values.
*   **Use Underscores for Readability:** For long bit strings or hex numbers, use underscores to group digits (e.g., `32'hDEAD_BEEF`, `16'b1111_0000_1010_0101`).
*   **Understand 2-state vs. 4-state:** Choose 2-state types (`bit`, `int`, etc.) when you are certain that `X` (unknown) and `Z` (high-impedance) values are not required for the logic being modeled. This can lead to performance improvements in simulation. For RTL design that interfaces with other blocks or models real hardware, 4-state types (`logic`, `integer`, etc.) are generally safer to correctly model unknown or uninitialized states.

By adhering to these practices, you can write more robust, readable, and maintainable SystemVerilog code.
