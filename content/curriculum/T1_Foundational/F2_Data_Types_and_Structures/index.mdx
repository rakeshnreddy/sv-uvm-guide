## The Foundation of Verification

Before you can build a testbench, you need to know your building blocks. SystemVerilog offers a rich set of data types that model everything from the voltage on a wire to a dynamic list of network packets.

In this module, we will cover:

1.  **[Core Data Types](./core_types)**: The difference between `logic`, `wire`, and `bit`, and why 4-state logic (`0`, `1`, `X`, `Z`) is critical for hardware modeling.
2.  **[Dynamic Structures](./dynamic_structures)**: How to use Arrays, Queues, and Associative Arrays to build flexible verification environments.

## Why It Matters

Choosing the wrong data type is the #1 source of "silent bugs" in verification.
- Using a 2-state `int` to model a bus signal will hide `X` (unknown) states, masking reset bugs.
- Using a static array for network traffic will cause buffer overflows or wasted memory.

Mastering these types gives you the vocabulary to describe hardware behavior precisely.
