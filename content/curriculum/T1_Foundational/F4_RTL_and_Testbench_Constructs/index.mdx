## Quick Take
- **What it is:** The structural side of SystemVerilog—modules, interfaces, packages, and clocking/program blocks—that shape both RTL and its verification harness.
- **Why it matters:** These constructs eliminate wiring mistakes, tame namespace chaos, and tame race conditions so design and testbench stay synchronized.
- **The Analogy:** Imagine a fabrication lab: **modules** are the devices under test, **interfaces** are the precision probe cards, **packages** are the labeled storage bins for shared gear, and **clocking blocks** are the metronome keeping every measurement on beat.

> **Visual cue:** Notice how each section couples long-form explanation with diagrams or code overlays so you get depth without a text wall.

### Interactive Examples
<InteractiveCode
  language="systemverilog"
  fileName="rtl_tb_constructs.sv"
  code={`
package bus_pkg;
  typedef enum logic [1:0] {IDLE, READ, WRITE} bus_cmd_e;
  typedef struct packed {
    bus_cmd_e cmd;
    logic [31:0] addr;
    logic [31:0] data;
  } bus_txn_s;
endpackage

interface bus_if(input logic clk);
  import bus_pkg::*;
  logic req, gnt;
  bus_txn_s txn;

  clocking tb_cb @(posedge clk);
    output req, txn;
    input  gnt;
  endclocking
endinterface

module dut (bus_if bus);
  import bus_pkg::*;
  // ... RTL implementation ...
endmodule

module tb_top;
  import bus_pkg::*;
  logic clk = 0;
  always #5 clk = ~clk;

  bus_if bus (clk);
  dut u_dut (.bus(bus));

  initial begin
    bus.tb_cb.req <= 0;
    repeat (2) @(posedge clk);
    bus.tb_cb.txn <= '{cmd: READ, addr: 'h100, data: '0};
    bus.tb_cb.req <= 1;
  end
endmodule

### Common Pitfalls
- Copy/pasting typedefs instead of placing them in a package, leading to mismatched transaction shapes.
- Driving interface signals directly without clocking blocks, introducing subtle race conditions in UVM environments.
- Treating `program` blocks as mandatory—modern UVM often omits them because they serialize stimuli and complicate phasing.

### Flow of Responsibilities
- **Modules** encapsulate hardware behavior and expose clean ports.
- **Interfaces** cluster related nets, embed tasks/functions, and provide a single handle for agents.
- **Packages** distribute shared definitions across modules, sequences, and scoreboards.
- **Clocking blocks** define when the testbench samples and drives signals relative to a clock edge.

## Make It Work
1. **Map your signals:** Sketch the bus or protocol you’re modeling; group related signals into an interface to prevent missed connections.
2. **Create a shared library:** Move enums, structs, and parameters into a package. Import it in both RTL and testbench so everyone speaks the same language.
3. **Stabilize timing:** Add a clocking block to the interface and make all stimulus/monitors drive through it. This keeps transactions aligned with the DUT clock.
4. **Decide on `program` usage:** If you use UVM, let the methodology handle ordering; otherwise, employ `program` blocks sparingly for legacy benches.

**Checklist before moving on:**
- [ ] You can explain the role of modules, interfaces, packages, and clocking blocks without notes.
- [ ] Your sample testbench uses an interface instead of a long positional port list.
- [ ] You can describe how clocking blocks eliminate race conditions between driver and monitor threads.

## Push Further
- Convert a legacy design that wires individual signals into one that uses an interface + package; measure the reduction in LOC and wiring bugs.
- Explore virtual interfaces in UVM components and observe how they allow agent reuse across sequencers and drivers.
- Experiment with multiple clocking blocks inside a single interface to support different timing domains (e.g., driver vs. monitor skew).

## Practice & Reinforce
- Flashcards – Review the definitions of module/interface/package/clocking block from the linked deck.
- Quiz – Complete the knowledge check below.
- Visual notebook – Capture before/after diagrams when refactoring a port list into an interface.
- Lab idea – Build a simple request/grant handshake using an interface, package, and clocking block, then integrate it into a UVM agent.
