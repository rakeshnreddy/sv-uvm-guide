## Quick Take
- **What it is:** Verification is the discipline of proving that a digital hardware design implements its specification and avoids unintended behavior before tape-out.
- **Why it matters:** The 2024 Wilson Research Group study reports that **66% of ASIC respins stem from logic/functional bugs**, and a single respin at 3 nm can exceed **$25 M** in mask + schedule cost (Synopsys foundry brief, 2025).
- **The Analogy:** Just as structural engineers stress-test a skyscraper blueprint before building 50 floors, verification teams stress-test RTL with simulations before it becomes irreversible silicon.

> **Note:** The entire curriculum follows a structured journey. Tier 1 builds fundamentals, Tier 2 layers in methodology, Tier 3 tackles advanced UVM patterns, and Tier 4 focuses on expert-level optimization and strategy.

### 2025 Industry Snapshot

<div className="my-6 space-y-2 rounded-xl border border-white/10 bg-background/60 p-4">
  <p className="font-semibold">Why teams invest heavily in verification:</p>
  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 text-sm">
    <li><strong>66%</strong> of ASIC respins trace back to logic/functional bugs (Siemens EDA Wilson Research Group, 2024).</li>
    <li><strong>76%</strong> of surveyed teams now combine simulation, formal, and emulation to hit coverage goals.</li>
    <li>Mask sets at 3 nm routinely cost **$25 M–$30 M**, and a respin adds 3–6 months to product launch (Synopsys/Semico, 2025).</li>
    <li>Automotive and medical designs must demonstrate ISO 26262 / IEC 62304 compliance—verification artifacts are part of the audit trail.</li>

### The Challenge of Modern Designs
Modern SoCs contain billions of transistors and interact with complex environments. Exhaustively trying every combination of inputs is impossible, so verification relies on automation, stimulus generation, and smart checking.

### Where SystemVerilog and UVM Fit
- **SystemVerilog** supplies the verification-friendly language features—object-oriented code, randomization, assertions—that let us model sophisticated tests.
- **UVM (Universal Verification Methodology)** provides the reusable architecture, base classes, and conventions for assembling those tests into scalable environments.

### Minimal Example: Design vs. Testbench
Understanding the difference between DUT and testbench is a first milestone.

```verilog
module and_gate (
  input  logic a,
  input  logic b,
  output logic y
);
  assign y = a & b;
endmodule
```

```systemverilog
module tb_and_gate;
  logic clk;
  logic a, b, y;

  // Instantiate the design we want to test
  and_gate dut (.a(a), .b(b), .y(y));

  // A simple procedure to apply inputs
  initial begin
    // Test case 1
    a = 0; b = 0; #10;
    $display("At time %0t, a=%b, b=%b, y=%b", $time, a, b, y);

    // Test case 2
    a = 0; b = 1; #10;
    $display("At time %0t, a=%b, b=%b, y=%b", $time, a, b, y);

    // ... add more test cases for 1&0 and 1&1
  end
endmodule
```

**Common Pitfalls**
- Treating verification as an afterthought—late bugs are exponentially costlier (Intel’s Pentium FDIV recall forced a $475 M reserve in 1994).
- Manually checking waveforms instead of automating pass/fail criteria.
- Skipping the mental model of complete **stimulus → observe → check** loop.
- Ignoring safety/security requirements—markets such as automotive require documented traceability from requirements to verification evidence.

## Make It Work
1. **Set up files:** Save the DUT as `and_gate.v` and the testbench as `tb_and_gate.sv`.
2. **Run a simulator:**
   ```bash
   # Synopsys VCS
   vcs -sverilog tb_and_gate.sv and_gate.v -o simv
   ./simv

   # Siemens Questa
   vlog and_gate.v tb_and_gate.sv
   vsim -c tb_and_gate -do "run -all; quit"

   # Cadence Xcelium
   xrun tb_and_gate.sv and_gate.v
   ```
3. **Inspect results:** Confirm the printed values match the truth table. Expand the testbench to cover all input combinations and add self-checking `if` statements or `assert` properties.

**Checklist before moving on:**
- [ ] You can explain the verification loop (stimulus → observe → check).
- [ ] You can describe why SystemVerilog and UVM are foundational to modern verification.
- [ ] You have run the sample testbench (or walked through how it would run with your preferred simulator).

## Verification Essentials Without UVM
- **Three pillars:** Instantiate the DUT, drive stimulus, and check results. Every sophisticated methodology—including UVM—still follows this loop.
- **Keep it self-checking:** Replace manual waveform inspection with assertions or `$error` calls so your bench can run unattended in regressions.
- **Automate scenarios:** Wrap stimulus and checking inside reusable tasks or classes so you can script dozens of cases without rewriting code.
- **Data + coverage:** Capture functional coverage alongside pass/fail so you know which scenarios actually ran.
- **Hands-on lab:** Walk through the [First Testbench lab](/labs/simple_dut/lab1_first_tb/) to practice building a self-checking bench before we introduce UVM scaffolding.

> **Accuracy checklist:** Before leaving Tier 1, confirm you can articulate the cost of a respin, name the top three verification failure modes for your domain, and map at least one coverage metric back to a requirement.

### Mini Test Plan Template

```markdown
| Feature / Scenario      | Stimulus Strategy                | Checker / Metric                  | Coverage Goal |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------|
| Power-on Reset          | Directed sequence + corner resets| Assertions on reset recovery time | 100% bins     |
| Mode Switching (A ↔ B)  | Randomize mode commands          | Scoreboard vs. reference model    | 95% bins      |
| Error Injection (parity)| Flip bits during transfer        | Self-checking task + log monitor  | 3/3 cases     |
```

Copy this table into your project README or verification plan document. Filling it in forces you to articulate intent before diving into code and mirrors the structure used in the Tier‑2/3 methodology modules.
