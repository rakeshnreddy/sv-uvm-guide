## Moore's Law is a party. Verification is the chaperone.

Silicon designers keep adding more logic, cores, and machine-learning accelerators to stay on Moore’s Law’s invite list. Verification has to inspect every rivet in that skyscraper before anyone moves in. The result is a widening “design and verification gap” — complexity doubles, but verification productivity inches forward linearly.

## The Verification Mindset

To bridge this gap, you must shift your thinking. Design is **constructive**—building something that works for the intended use case. Verification is **destructive**—relentlessly searching for the conditions under which the design breaks.

## Common Pitfalls for New Verifiers

> [!WARNING]
> **Don't Trust the Spec Blindly**
> Specifications are written by humans and often contain ambiguities or errors. If the RTL matches the spec but the behavior seems wrong, question the spec.

> [!CAUTION]
> **The "It Works on My Machine" Trap**
> Just because a test passes once doesn't mean it's robust. Verification relies on **Constrained Random Verification (CRV)** to hit scenarios you didn't explicitly think of. A test that passes with one seed might fail with another.
