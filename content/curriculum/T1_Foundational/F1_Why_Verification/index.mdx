## Moore's Law is a party. Verification is the chaperone.

Silicon designers keep adding more logic, cores, and machine-learning accelerators to stay on Moore’s Law’s invite list. Verification has to inspect every rivet in that skyscraper before anyone moves in. The result is a widening “design and verification gap” — complexity doubles, but verification productivity inches forward linearly.

    Verification asks, <strong>“Are we building the product right?”</strong> — the disciplined inspection of every logic path, handshake, and failure mode. Validation asks, <strong>“Are we building the right product?”</strong> — checking that the finished system meets customer intent. Think of a chef: verification is following the recipe precisely; validation is serving diners what they actually ordered.
