## Constructive vs. Destructive Thinking

The most important tool in verification isn't SystemVerilog—it's your mindset.

*   **Designers are Constructive:** They build pathways for data to flow. They ask, "How do I make this work?"
*   **Verifiers are Destructive:** They look for cracks in the pavement. They ask, "How can I make this fail?"

## Verification Methodologies

How do we systematically break things?

<VerificationMethodologiesDiagram />

### 1. Directed Testing
Manually writing a test for a specific scenario.
*   **Pros:** Easy to write, deterministic, good for basic sanity checks.
*   **Cons:** Cannot scale. You only find the bugs you can imagine.

### 2. Constrained Random Verification (CRV)
The industry standard (and the focus of this course). You define the *rules* (constraints) and let the solver generate the *scenarios*.
*   **Pros:** Finds bugs you never thought of. Covers massive state space.
*   **Cons:** Harder to debug. Requires functional coverage to know what happened.

### 3. Formal Verification
Using mathematical proofs to verify properties.
*   **Pros:** Exhaustive. Proves absence of bugs for specific properties.
*   **Cons:** Doesn't scale to large full-chip designs. Requires assertions.

## Coverage: The Scoreboard

If you are generating random tests, how do you know when you are done?

*   **Code Coverage:** Did I execute every line of RTL code? (Automatic)
*   **Functional Coverage:** Did I see every interesting scenario defined in the test plan? (Manual)

> [!TIP]
> **Code Coverage is Necessary but Not Sufficient**
> You can have 100% code coverage and still miss a major bug if the feature was never implemented in the RTL! Functional coverage checks the *intent*, not just the *implementation*.

## Interactive: Your First Bug Hunt

You are the verifier. The designer has handed you a simple FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer. Your job is to break it.

        <p>No. Code coverage only tells you that the tests exercised the code that <em>exists</em>. It cannot tell you about missing features (code that <em>should</em> be there but isn't). You need <strong>Functional Coverage</strong> to verify that all requirements from the spec have been tested.</p>
