## Why this module matters

SystemVerilog only pays off when the types, assignments, and concurrency you choose mirror the hardware you intend to build. The F2 module strings those decisions together—from picking the right value system to coordinating parallel stimulus—so later UVM concepts have something concrete to stand on.

## What to expect

- **2.5 hours of focused practice** split across four lessons.
- **Interactive explorers** that show how data types, state, and procedural code behave before you ever run synthesis.
- **Gamified checkpoints** so you can check reasoning before moving ahead.

## Lessons in this track

- [F2A: Core Data Types](/curriculum/T1_Foundational/F2A_Core_Data_Types/) — explore nets vs. variables, 2-state vs. 4-state types, and decode the hardware implications of every declaration.
- [F2B: Dynamic Data Structures](/curriculum/T1_Foundational/F2B_Dynamic_Structures/) — practice dynamic arrays, queues, and associative arrays that underpin scoreboards and stimulus generators.
- [F2C: Procedural Code and Flow Control](/curriculum/T1_Foundational/F2C_Procedural_Code/) — master blocking/non-blocking semantics and the simulator scheduling model.
- [F2D: Reusable Code and Parallelism](/curriculum/T1_Foundational/F2D_Reusable_and_Parallel/) — compose tasks, functions, and fork-join patterns to build scalable verification code.

## When to revisit

- Debugging `X/Z` propagation? Re-run **F2A** to confirm type choices and reset coverage.
- Adding scoreboard storage? **F2B** compares data structure trade-offs before you “just add another queue.”
- Confused by scheduling surprises? **F2C** refreshes the mental model for blocking versus non-blocking updates.
- Coordinating concurrent drivers? **F2D** highlights reusable concurrency patterns before you layer on UVM sequences.

> Tip: Track your progress via the breadcrumb progress badge—if it shows partial completion, re-open the lessons above until the module turns green.
