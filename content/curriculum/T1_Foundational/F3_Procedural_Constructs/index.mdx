## Level 1: The Elevator Pitch

**What is it?** Procedural constructs are the parts of SystemVerilog that look and feel like a traditional programming language. They allow you to write sequential, algorithmic code to control the flow of your testbench and model complex behavior.

**The Analogy:** Think of procedural constructs as the "recipe" for your testbench. The `initial` and `always` blocks are the cooking instructions, and the flow control statements (`if`, `for`, `while`) are the steps in the recipe.

**Why this matters:** Procedural constructs are the workhorses of any testbench. You'll use them to generate stimulus, create complex checking logic, and control the overall flow of your tests.

## Level 2: The Practical Explanation

### `initial`, `always`, and `final` blocks

- **`initial` blocks** are executed only once at the beginning of a simulation.
- **`always` blocks** are executed continuously throughout a simulation.
- **`final` blocks** are executed only once at the end of a simulation.

### Blocking vs. Non-blocking Assignments

A critical concept in procedural blocks is the difference between blocking (`=`) and non-blocking (`<=`) assignments.

- **Blocking assignments (`=`)** are executed in the order they appear in the code.
- **Non-blocking assignments (`<=`)** are scheduled to occur at the end of the current time step.

<InteractiveCode>
```systemverilog
// Example of always_ff for a simple flip-flop
logic clk, reset, d_in, q_out;
always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
  if (reset) begin
    q_out <= 1'b0; // Use non-blocking for state elements
  end else begin
    q_out <= d_in;
  end
end

// Example of always_comb for combinational logic
logic a, b, c, y_comb;
always_comb begin
  y_comb = a & b | c; // Use blocking for combinational logic
end
```
</InteractiveCode>

## Level 3: Expert Insights

**Race Conditions:** A common source of bugs in procedural code is race conditions. This is when the order of execution of two or more concurrent processes is not guaranteed. Using non-blocking assignments in sequential logic helps to avoid race conditions.

**Simulation vs. Synthesis:** Not all procedural constructs are synthesizable. For example, `initial` blocks are generally not synthesizable, and `final` blocks are never synthesizable.

**Memory & Retention Tip:** Remember: **Non-blocking for sequential logic (`always_ff`), blocking for combinational logic (`always_comb`) and testbench procedural code.**
