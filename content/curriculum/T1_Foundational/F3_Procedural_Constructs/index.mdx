# Procedural Constructs

SystemVerilog provides a variety of procedural constructs for controlling the flow of execution in a testbench. These constructs are essential for creating complex stimulus and for building reactive testbenches that can respond to the behavior of the DUT.

## `initial`, `always`, and `final` blocks

*   **`initial` blocks** are executed only once at the beginning of a simulation. They are often used for initialization tasks, such as setting up the testbench environment and applying initial stimulus to the DUT.
*   **`always` blocks** are executed continuously throughout a simulation. They are used to model combinational and sequential logic, and to create reactive testbenches that can respond to changes in the DUT's state.
*   **`final` blocks** are executed only once at the end of a simulation. They are often used for cleanup tasks, such as printing simulation statistics and closing files.

## Procedural Flow Control

SystemVerilog provides a variety of procedural flow control statements, including:

*   `if-else`
*   `case`
*   `for`
*   `while`
*   `do-while`
*   `forever`
*   `repeat`

## Tasks and Functions

*   **Tasks** are subroutines that can have input, output, and inout arguments. They can also consume time, which makes them useful for modeling sequential behavior.
*   **Functions** are subroutines that can have input arguments and must return a value. They cannot consume time, which makes them useful for modeling combinational logic.

## Process Control

SystemVerilog provides a variety of process control statements, including:

*   `fork-join`
*   `fork-join_any`
*   `fork-join_none`
*   `disable`
*   `wait`

These statements are used to control the execution of concurrent processes in a testbench.
