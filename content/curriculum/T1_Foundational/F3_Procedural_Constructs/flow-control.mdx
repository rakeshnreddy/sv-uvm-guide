  ## Elevator Pitch

  Flow control statements decide which lines of code run and how oftenâ€”much like traffic lights and roundabouts directing cars on a road.

  ## Practical Explanation

  ```systemverilog
  int i;

  if (i == 0) begin
    $display("zero");
  end else begin
    $display("non-zero");
  end

  case (i)
    1: $display("one");
    2,3: $display("two or three");
    default: $display("other");
  endcase

  repeat (4) begin
    i++;
  end
  ```

  * `if/else` chooses between branches.
  * `case` matches against multiple values.
  * Loops like `for`, `repeat`, and `while` run code repeatedly. Use them inside <Link href="/curriculum/T1_Foundational/F3_Procedural_Constructs/tasks-functions">tasks or functions</Link> to build reusable behavior.

  ## Advanced Notes

  * The `unique`/`priority` keywords warn about overlapping or missing `case` branches.
  * `forever` loops require an explicit `break` or `disable` to exit.
  * Avoid unintended latches by covering every branch in combinational always blocks.
