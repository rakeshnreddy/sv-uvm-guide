## Quick Take
- **Functions:** Execute in zero time. Use them for math, data conversion, or non-blocking operations.
- **Tasks:** Can consume time (wait for clocks, delays). Use them for driving stimulus or modeling bus cycles.
- **Lifetimes:** Always use `automatic` (or declare inside a class) to ensure variables are fresh for each call.

## Choosing the Right Tool

SystemVerilog splits subroutines into two types based on their relationship with simulation time.

## Lifetimes: `static` vs `automatic`

This is a classic "gotcha." By default in modules, subroutines are `static`, meaning they share variables across all calls. This breaks recursion and concurrent usage.

> **Best Practice:** Always declare tasks and functions as `automatic` (or put them in a `class`, where they are automatic by default).

```systemverilog
// BAD: Static by default. Concurrent calls will corrupt 'i'.
task drive_bus;
  int i; // Shared memory address!
  // ...
endtask

// GOOD: Fresh 'i' for every call.
task automatic drive_bus;
  int i; // Allocated on stack
  // ...
endtask
```

## Argument Passing

How you pass data matters for performance and correctness.

| Direction | Behavior | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`input`** | Copy-in on start. | Default. Safe but copies data. |
| **`output`** | Copy-out on return. | Value updates only when routine finishes. |
| **`inout`** | Copy-in start, Copy-out return. | Legacy; rarely used in modern TBs. |
| **`ref`** | Reference (pointer). | **Zero-copy.** Updates are visible immediately. Use `const ref` for large arrays. |

## Interactive Example: Refactoring Stimulus
We start with a messy `initial` block and refactor it into a clean, reusable `task`.

<InteractiveCode
  language="systemverilog"
  fileName="refactoring_demo.sv"
  code={`
module refactoring_demo;
  logic clk;
  logic [7:0] data;
  logic valid;

  // 1. Define a reusable task
  task automatic send_packet(input byte payload, input int repeat_count);
    $display("@%0t: Sending payload %h", $time, payload);
    for (int i = 0; i < repeat_count; i++) begin
      @(posedge clk);
      data  <= payload;
      valid <= 1'b1;
      @(posedge clk);
      valid <= 1'b0;
    end
  endtask

  // 2. Helper function for calculation
  function automatic bit parity(input byte payload);
    return ^payload; // XOR reduce
  endfunction

  // Clock gen
  initial begin
    clk = 0;
    forever #5 clk = ~clk;
  end

  // 3. Clean Main Flow
  initial begin
    valid = 0;
    data = 0;
    
    // Call the task multiple times
    send_packet(8'hA5, 2);
    send_packet(8'h5A, 1);
    
    $display("Parity check: %b", parity(8'hA5));
    $finish;
  end
endmodule
  `}

## Practice Prompts
1.  **Refactor**: Take a block of code that waits for a reset signal and turn it into a `task wait_for_reset()`.
2.  **Optimize**: Change a function that takes a large array as `input` to use `const ref` instead.
3.  **Debug**: Remove the `automatic` keyword from a recursive function (like factorial) and see it fail.

      question: 'Why can a function NOT call a task?',
      answers: [
        { text: 'Because functions are not synthesizable', correct: false },

      explanation:
        'The fundamental rule of functions is that they execute in zero simulation time. Calling a task (which might block) would violate this.'

      question: 'What is the benefit of passing arguments by `ref`?',
      answers: [
        { text: 'It is required for synthesis', correct: false },
        { text: 'It automatically makes the variable static', correct: false },
        { text: 'It avoids copying large data structures, improving performance', correct: true },
        { text: 'It allows the routine to consume time', correct: false }
      ],
      explanation:
        '`ref` passes a handle/pointer to the original data rather than copying it. This is crucial for performance when passing large arrays or objects.'
