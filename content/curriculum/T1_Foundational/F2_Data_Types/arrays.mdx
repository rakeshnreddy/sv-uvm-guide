  ## Elevator Pitch

  Arrays are containers that hold multiple elements of the same type. SystemVerilog offers several kinds&mdash;from fixed-size **packed** arrays to flexible **dynamic** and **queue** structures&mdash;so you can pick the right tool for data organization.

  ## Practical Explanation

  ```systemverilog
  // Packed vs. unpacked
  bit   [3:0] nibble;       // packed: acts like a 4-bit vector
  byte  bytes   [4];        // unpacked: array of four bytes

  // Dynamic array and queue
  int   dyn[];              // size set at runtime
  int   q[$];               // queue: push_front/back

  initial begin
    dyn = new[3];           // allocate
    q.push_back(42);
  end
  ```

  Use a **packed** array when you need bit-level operations (e.g., slicing), an **unpacked** array for collections, a **dynamic** array when size changes at runtime, a **queue** for FIFO/LIFO behavior, and an **associative** array when indices are sparse or not numeric.

  Need custom element types? See <Link href="/curriculum/T1_Foundational/F2_Data_Types/user-defined">user-defined types</Link> for struct/enum examples.

  ## Advanced Notes

  * Dynamic arrays and queues support `delete()`, `size()`, and iteration methods.
  * Associative arrays can use strings or enums as indices, enabling lookups like a dictionary.
  * Remember: **packed = bit-level**, **unpacked = container**.
