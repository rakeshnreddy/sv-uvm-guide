## Quick Take
- **What it is:** SystemVerilog data types capture both uncertain hardware reality (`X`/`Z`) and fast software-like behavior for verification logic.
- **Why it matters:** A mismatched type can mask bugs, slow a regression, or break connectivity—choosing wisely keeps designs faithful *and* fast.
- **The Analogy:** Think of a lab bench: `logic` is the robust oscilloscope probe, `wire` is the shared power rail, and `bit`/`int` are the precision tweezers for fine adjustments.

> **Visual cue:** Data type concepts are paired with comparison charts, glassmorphism cards, and code overlays so the page feels like an interactive schematic, not a wall of text.

### Minimal Example (Interactive)
<InteractiveCode
  language="systemverilog"
  fileName="data_types_examples.sv"
  code={`
logic my_logic_var; // 4-state: 0, 1, X, Z
bit   my_bit_var;   // 2-state: 0, 1

logic [7:0] data_bus [3:0]; // Unpacked array of 4 packed bytes
int         dynamic_array[]; // Dynamic array for elastic storage
string      assoc_array[string]; // Associative array indexed by string

typedef struct packed {
  logic [15:0] address;
  logic [31:0] data;
  bit          valid;
} memory_transaction_s;

memory_transaction_s transaction_q[$]; // Queue of transactions
  `}

### Common Pitfalls
- Declaring packed dimensions on the wrong side of the identifier, flipping bit order.
- Throwing `logic` at every variable—even ones that never touch hardware—leading to unnecessary `X` propagation and slow sims.
- Forgetting that nets (`wire`, `tri`) exist for multi-driver scenarios, while variables (`logic`, `bit`) expect a single driver.

## Make It Work
1. **Sketch your signal map:** Draw your DUT interface and annotate each line: tri-state nets become `wire`, uni-directional ports default to `logic`, internal counters live as `bit`/`int`.
2. **Instrument for visibility:** Add assertions that alert when a `logic` signal drifts to `X/Z` outside of reset—turn uncertainty into obvious color in waveforms.
3. **Prototype data structures:** Use the interactive code block as a sandbox to build queues, associative arrays, or structs that mirror your verification plan.

**Checklist before moving on:**
- [ ] You can explain (without peeking) when to select `logic`, `wire`, `bit`, and higher-level aggregates.
- [ ] Your personal lab/testbench already mixes 4-state and 2-state types intentionally.
- [ ] You’ve captured or sketched the comparison chart to keep near your workstation.

## Push Further
- Benchmark a regression with `logic` scoreboards versus `bit` scoreboards and report the runtime delta.
- Explore nettypes (`tri`, `wand`, `wor`) and document how UVM components interact with them.
- Serialize a packed struct into a mailbox and deserialize it inside a monitor—visualize the before/after with a WaveDrom diagram.

## Practice & Reinforce
- Flashcards – Drill definitions from the associated deck.
- Quiz – Complete the built-in knowledge check at the end of this page.
- Visual notebook – Capture waveform screenshots highlighting `X/Z` propagation versus clean 2-state behavior.
- Mini-lab – Extend the interactive example to randomize queue size and measure simulator performance.

  questions={[
    {
      question: 'Which data type is best suited for a bus that multiple modules may drive (e.g., tri-state bus)?',
      answers: [
        { text: 'bit', correct: false },
        { text: 'logic', correct: false },
        { text: 'wire', correct: true },
        { text: 'int', correct: false }
      ],
      explanation:
        '`wire` (a net type) resolves multiple drivers and mirrors shared hardware connections. Use it when more than one source might drive the line.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Why might you prefer a 2-state type like `bit` for a scoreboard data structure?',
      answers: [
        { text: 'It can store unknown (X) states.', correct: false },
        { text: 'It automatically connects to multiple drivers.', correct: false },
        { text: 'It reduces simulation runtime and memory footprint.', correct: true },
        { text: 'It is required by the UVM base classes.', correct: false }
      ],
      explanation:
        '2-state types keep the simulator from tracking `X/Z` values, which speeds up execution and lowers memory consumption for large datasets.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Where should you place packed dimensions when declaring a vector?',
      answers: [
        { text: 'To the right of the identifier', correct: false },
        { text: 'To the left of the identifier', correct: true },
        { text: 'Either side is equivalent', correct: false },
        { text: 'Inside a comment for clarity', correct: false }
      ],
      explanation:
        'Packed dimensions must appear to the left (`logic [7:0] bus`) so the compiler treats them as contiguous bits. Unpacked dimensions trail the identifier.'
