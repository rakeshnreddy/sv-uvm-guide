## Level 1: The Elevator Pitch

**What is it?** SystemVerilog is the universal language of modern chip design. It's used to both design and verify hardware.

**The Analogy:** Think of SystemVerilog as the "English" of the hardware world. It's the language that everyone speaks, whether they're designing the chip or testing it.

**Why this matters:** To be a verification engineer, you need to be fluent in SystemVerilog. It's the language you'll use every day to write testbenches, create stimulus, and check for bugs.

## Level 2: A Practical Explanation

### Module Structure

The fundamental building block of any SystemVerilog design or testbench is the `module`. A module is a self-contained block with a defined set of `ports` (inputs and outputs) that allow it to connect to other modules.

<InteractiveCode
  code={`
module my_module (
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic reset,
  output logic [7:0] data_out
);
  // Module content goes here
endmodule
  `}
  language="systemverilog"
/>

### The 'logic' Data Type

The most common data type in SystemVerilog is `logic`, which is a **4-state** type.
- **0**: Logic zero.
- **1**: Logic one.
- **X**: An unknown value.
- **Z**: High-impedance.

### Procedural Blocks

Procedural blocks are chunks of code that execute in a more "program-like" way.
- **`initial` block**: Executes once at the beginning of the simulation.
- **`always_comb` block**: Models combinational logic.
- **`always_ff` block**: Models sequential, or clocked, logic.

## Level 3: A 10-Year Veteran's Perspective

A common point of confusion is the difference between "synthesizable" and "non-synthesizable" SystemVerilog.
- **Synthesizable code** is a subset of the language that can be automatically converted into a physical hardware implementation.
- **Non-synthesizable code** includes the full power of the language, with many abstract constructs that are incredibly useful for verification but have no direct hardware equivalent.

As a verification engineer, you have the freedom to use the entire language to its fullest extent to stress the DUT.

    {
      "question": "In a simulation, what does an 'X' value on a signal typically represent?",
      "answers": [
        {"text": "A high-impedance or disconnected state.", "correct": false},
        {"text": "A signal that is intentionally unused.", "correct": false},
        {"text": "An unknown or uninitialized value, potentially indicating a design bug.", "correct": true},
        {"text": "A special value used for clock signals only.", "correct": false}
      ],
      "explanation": "An 'X' can indicate an uninitialized register, or a situation where two drivers are trying to drive the same wire to different values (contention)."

    {
      "question": "Which procedural block is specifically designed to model clocked, sequential logic like flip-flops?",
      "answers": [
        {"text": "initial", "correct": false},
        {"text": "always_comb", "correct": false},
        {"text": "always_ff", "correct": true},
        {"text": "function", "correct": false}
      ],
      "explanation": "`always_ff` is used to model sequential logic that is sensitive to a clock edge."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why can verification engineers use language features that are 'non-synthesizable'?",
      "answers": [
        {"text": "Because testbenches are manually converted to gates.", "correct": false},
        {"text": "Because the testbench code does not need to be converted into physical hardware, it only runs in a simulator.", "correct": true},
        {"text": "Because modern synthesis tools can handle all SystemVerilog constructs.", "correct": false},
        {"text": "Because non-synthesizable code runs faster.", "correct": false}
      ],
      "explanation": "The testbench is a software program that runs in a simulator, so it can use the full power of the SystemVerilog language, including non-synthesizable constructs."
