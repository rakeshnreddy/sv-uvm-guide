## The Atoms of Hardware - More Than Just Bits
_In hardware, every “bit” has a story._

SystemVerilog data types are not abstract software variables—they are blueprints for transistors, wires, and storage. Each declaration tells the synthesis tool whether to emit a routed net, a bank of flip-flops, or arithmetic hardware. Make the wrong choice and you either hide a real bug behind forced zeros or fabricate logic the chip never needed (IEEE 1800-2023 §6).

- **Nets (e.g., `wire`, `tri`)** represent physical connections continuously driven by other elements. They resolve conflicts, surface floating nodes, and happily take on `Z` when nobody is home (§6.6–§6.7).
- **Variables (e.g., `logic`, `bit`, `int`, `byte`, `reg`)** model storage written procedurally inside `always` blocks or class methods. Their initial value and value system determine how quickly an uninitialised bug becomes visible (§6.8–§6.10).

Use this mental model: nets are the copper traces on a board, while variables are the latches and registers feeding those traces.

## The Two Universes: 2-State vs. 4-State Logic
_Embracing the unknown: why `X` is your best friend._

The simulator tracks more than binary `0` and `1`. Four-state types surface hardware realities that software programmers rarely face—contention (`X`) and high impedance (`Z`). Choosing the wrong value system can either hide faults or slow verification to a crawl.

- **2-state types (`bit`, `int`, `byte`, `shortint`, …)** only take `0/1`. They simulate fast and map neatly to arithmetic hardware, but any attempt to assign `X/Z` collapses to `0` (§6.4).
- **4-state types (`logic`, `reg`, `wire`, `tri`, …)** represent `0/1/X/Z`. They are essential for verification and for modeling shared resources. Their defaults (`'x` for variables, `'z` for nets) force you to handle reset and contention deliberately (§6.1, §6.6).

## Interactive Data Type Explorer (Core Component)
_Get your hands dirty: a data type sandbox._

Meet the explorer: pick a type, click through its legal values, and watch the properties panel update in real time. Each selection is backed by the IEEE 1800-2023 LRM, so you always know which clause defends your coding choice.

## Signed vs. Unsigned: The Silent Killer
_Positive or negative? Your ALU cares._

Signedness changes how the simulator interprets the exact same bits. Forgetting that `logic [3:0]` is unsigned burns many first-time SystemVerilog authors.

```systemverilog
int signed_var = -4;
logic [3:0] unsigned_var = 4'b1100;

display_signed_and_unsigned();
// signed_var   = -4  // two's complement 32-bit signed
// unsigned_var = 12  // 4'b1100 interpreted as unsigned (IEEE 1800-2023 §6.10)
```

Use these tactics:

- Declare `logic signed [WIDTH-1:0]` or cast with `$signed()` when negative arithmetic matters.
- Keep scoreboard math in `int`/`longint`; convert to packed logic only when you must match a bus width.
- Remember that assignments between 4-state and 2-state types can lose `X/Z`, so guard the conversion with assertions (§6.4).

## Strings: The Unsung Hero
_More than just testbench logs._

Unlike C, SystemVerilog strings are dynamic, resizeable, and packed with built-in methods. They are essential for parsing register names, formatting reports, and manipulating file paths in UVM.

## Enumerations: Type-Safe States
_Stop using magic numbers._

Enumerations (`enum`) define a set of named values. Unlike `parameter` constants, enums are strongly typed (mostly), preventing you from accidentally assigning a state machine variable to a FIFO depth. They also come with built-in methods for iteration, which is a lifesaver for coverage.

```systemverilog
typedef enum logic [1:0] {
  IDLE  = 2'b00,
  START = 2'b01,
  BUSY  = 2'b10,
  ERROR = 2'b11
} state_e;

state_e current_state = IDLE;
```

## Common Pitfalls

> [!WARNING]
> **X-Optimism in `if` Statements**
> Be careful with `if (signal)` when `signal` is `X`. SystemVerilog treats `X` as false in boolean contexts.
> ```systemverilog
> logic a = 1'bx;
> if (a) $display("True"); else $display("False"); // Prints "False"!
> ```
> This can hide bugs where an uninitialized signal causes the design to take the "safe" default path.

> [!TIP]
> **Use `===` for Exact Matching**
> When verifying resets or checking for X propagation, use the case equality operator `===` which treats `X` and `Z` as literal values to match, unlike `==` which treats them as "don't care" or returns `X`.
