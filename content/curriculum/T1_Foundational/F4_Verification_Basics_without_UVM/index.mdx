## Introduction

You've learned the basic syntax of SystemVerilog and how to model hardware behavior. Now, how do you test that hardware? Before we jump into a powerful, industrial-strength methodology like UVM, it's essential to build a simple testbench from scratch. This will help you understand the fundamental components of any verification environment and appreciate why a framework like UVM is so valuable.

## The Design Under Test (DUT): A Simple ALU

For this module, our DUT will be a simple 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). It can perform two operations: ADD and SUBTRACT.

<InteractiveCode>
```systemverilog
// The Design Under Test (DUT)
module alu (
  input  logic [3:0] a, b,
  input  logic       opcode, // 0 for ADD, 1 for SUBTRACT
  output logic [4:0] result
);

  always_comb begin
    if (opcode == 0)
      result = a + b;
    else
      result = a - b;
  end

endmodule
```
</InteractiveCode>

## Testbench Components: The "What"

Every testbench, regardless of its complexity, performs three basic functions.

1.  **Stimulus Generator (Driver):** This component is responsible for creating input data and "driving" it to the DUT's input pins, following the DUT's protocol.
2.  **Response Checker (Monitor/Checker):** This component observes the DUT's output pins, captures the results, and checks if they match the expected outcome.
3.  **Test Sequencer (The Test):** This is the "brain" of the testbench. It controls the overall flow, deciding what stimulus to generate and in what order, and when the test is complete.

## Building the Testbench Step-by-Step

Let's build a testbench for our ALU.

### Step 1: The Top Module & Clock

First, we create a top-level module that will contain our DUT and all our testbench logic. We also need a clock signal to synchronize our test.

<InteractiveCode>
```systemverilog
`timescale 1ns/1ps

module tb_alu;

  // Testbench signals
  logic clk;
  logic [3:0] a, b;
  logic       opcode;
  logic [4:0] result;

  // Instantiate the DUT
  alu dut (
    .a(a),
    .b(b),
    .opcode(opcode),
    .result(result)
  );

  // Clock generator
  initial begin
    clk = 0;
    forever #5 clk = ~clk; // 10ns period clock
  end

  // Test scenario will go here...
  initial begin
    $display("Starting ALU Testbench...");
    // ...
    $finish;
  end

endmodule
```
</InteractiveCode>

### Step 2: Generating Stimulus (The Driver Task)

Instead of just assigning values in the `initial` block, let's create a reusable `task` to drive a transaction. This makes our test cleaner and easier to read.

```systemverilog
  // Task to drive one transaction
  task drive_transaction(input [3:0] i_a, i_b, input logic i_op);
    @(posedge clk); // Wait for a clock edge
    a = i_a;
    b = i_b;
    opcode = i_op;
    $display("DRV: Driving a=%0d, b=%0d, op=%s", i_a, i_b, (i_op ? "SUB" : "ADD"));
  endtask
```

### Step 3: Checking a Response (The Checker Task)

Similarly, let's create a task to check the DUT's output. It will take the expected value as an input and report whether the test passed or failed.

```systemverilog
  // Task to check the result
  task check_response(input [4:0] expected_result);
    @(posedge clk); // Wait for the result to be ready
    if (result == expected_result) begin
      $display("PASS: Result %0d == Expected %0d", result, expected_result);
    end else begin
      $error("FAIL: Result %0d != Expected %0d", result, expected_result);
    end
  endtask
```

### Step 4: The Test Scenario

Now we can use our tasks to create a readable test sequence in the main `initial` block.

```systemverilog
  // Main test scenario
  initial begin
    $display("Starting ALU Testbench...");

    // Test 1: 5 + 3 = 8
    drive_transaction(5, 3, 0);
    check_response(8);

    // Test 2: 10 - 4 = 6
    drive_transaction(10, 4, 1);
    check_response(6);

    // Test 3: 2 - 5 = -3 (represented as 29 in 5-bit 2's complement)
    drive_transaction(2, 5, 1);
    check_response(5'b11101); // -3 in 5-bit 2's complement

    $display("ALU Testbench Finished.");
    $finish;
  end
```

## The Complete Testbench

Here is the full code for our simple, non-UVM testbench.

<InteractiveCode>
```systemverilog
`timescale 1ns/1ps

module tb_alu;

  // Testbench signals
  logic clk;
  logic [3:0] a, b;
  logic       opcode;
  logic [4:0] result;

  // Instantiate the DUT
  alu dut (
    .a(a),
    .b(b),
    .opcode(opcode),
    .result(result)
  );

  // Clock generator
  initial begin
    clk = 0;
    forever #5 clk = ~clk; // 10ns period clock
  end

  // Task to drive one transaction
  task drive_transaction(input [3:0] i_a, i_b, input logic i_op);
    @(posedge clk); // Wait for a clock edge
    a = i_a;
    b = i_b;
    opcode = i_op;
    $display("DRV: Driving a=%0d, b=%0d, op=%s", i_a, i_b, (i_op ? "SUB" : "ADD"));
  endtask

  // Task to check the result
  task check_response(input [4:0] expected_result);
    @(posedge clk); // Wait for the result to be ready
    if (result == expected_result) begin
      $display("PASS: Result %0d == Expected %0d", result, expected_result);
    end else begin
      $error("FAIL: Result %0d != Expected %0d", result, expected_result);
    end
  endtask

  // Main test scenario
  initial begin
    $display("Starting ALU Testbench...");

    // Test 1: 5 + 3 = 8
    drive_transaction(5, 3, 0);
    check_response(8);

    // Test 2: 10 - 4 = 6
    drive_transaction(10, 4, 1);
    check_response(6);

    // Test 3: 2 - 5 = -3
    drive_transaction(2, 5, 1);
    check_response(5'b11101); // -3 in 5-bit 2's complement

    $display("ALU Testbench Finished.");
    $finish;
  end

endmodule
```
</InteractiveCode>

## Conclusion: Why This Isn't Enough

This testbench works, but it has serious limitations:

*   **Not Reusable:** The `drive_transaction` and `check_response` tasks are tightly coupled to the `alu` module. Using them for a different DUT would require significant rewriting.
*   **Not Scalable:** Imagine a DUT with 10 different interfaces. This single-file, task-based approach would become incredibly messy and hard to manage.
*   **No Randomization:** We are only testing a few hand-picked values. A real design needs to be tested with thousands or millions of random inputs to find corner-case bugs.
*   **No Standard Structure:** If another engineer joined the project, they would have to learn your specific testbench structure from scratch. There's no common methodology.

These limitations are exactly what UVM is designed to solve. UVM provides a standardized, scalable, and reusable framework for building powerful verification environments. Now that you understand the basic pieces of a testbench, you're ready to see how UVM organizes them into a professional verification solution.
