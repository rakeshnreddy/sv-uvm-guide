## Why OOP for Verification?

In the last module, we built a testbench using modules and tasks. It worked, but we identified major limitations: it wasn't reusable, scalable, or structured. How do we solve these problems? The answer is **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.

OOP is a programming paradigm that allows us to create powerful, reusable, and organized verification components. Instead of thinking in terms of static modules and tasks, OOP lets us create "objects" that model complex data (like network packets or bus transactions) and represent dynamic components (like drivers and monitors). This is the foundation upon which UVM is built.

## Classes and Objects: Blueprints and Instances

The two most fundamental concepts in OOP are the **class** and the **object**.

*   **Class:** A class is a **blueprint**. It defines a new data type, including its data (properties) and its behaviors (methods). For example, we can define a `class Car` that has properties like `color` and `make`, and methods like `start_engine()`.
*   **Object:** An object is an **instance** of a class. It's a concrete realization of the blueprint. If `class Car` is the blueprint, your specific `red Toyota` is an object. You can create many objects from a single class blueprint.

In SystemVerilog, we define a class with the `class ... endclass` keywords. To create an object from the class blueprint, we use the `new()` keyword. The variable that holds the object is called a **handle**. A handle is like a remote control for the object.

<InteractiveCode>
```systemverilog
// Define the blueprint for a simple packet
class MyPacket;
  int data;
endclass

module test_oop;
  initial begin
    // 1. Declare a handle for a MyPacket object.
    // At this point, the handle is 'null', it doesn't point to any object.
    MyPacket pkt_h;

    // 2. Create a MyPacket object in memory and assign its address to the handle.
    pkt_h = new();

    // 3. Use the handle to access the object's properties.
    pkt_h.data = 100;
    $display("Packet data is: %0d", pkt_h.data);
  end
endmodule
```
</InteractiveCode>

## Properties and Methods

*   **Properties:** These are the variables inside a class that hold its data or state.
*   **Methods:** These are the `tasks` and `functions` defined inside a class that determine its behavior.

Let's create a more useful `AluTransaction` class to model an operation for the ALU from our previous module.

<InteractiveCode>
```systemverilog
class AluTransaction;

  // --- Properties (the data) ---
  logic [3:0] a;
  logic [3:0] b;
  enum {ADD, SUB} opcode;

  // --- Methods (the behavior) ---

  // A method to print the contents of the transaction
  function void print();
    $display("Transaction: a=%h, b=%h, opcode=%s", a, b, opcode.name());
  endfunction

endclass
```
</InteractiveCode>

## Constructors (`new()`)

The `new()` function is a special method called a **constructor**. It is automatically called when you create an object. You can define your own `new()` function to set default values or perform other initialization.

```systemverilog
class AluTransaction;
  // ... properties ...

  // The constructor
  function new();
    // Initialize properties with default values
    a = 1;
    b = 1;
    opcode = ADD;
  endfunction

  // ... other methods ...
endclass
```

## Introduction to Randomization

One of the most powerful features of using classes in verification is the ability to easily generate random stimulus.

*   **`rand` keyword:** By declaring a class property as `rand`, you mark it as a random variable.
*   **`.randomize()` method:** Every class has a built-in `.randomize()` method. When you call it on an object, the simulator will assign random values to all of its `rand` properties.

<InteractiveCode>
```systemverilog
class AluTransaction;

  // Mark properties as random
  rand logic [3:0] a;
  rand logic [3:0] b;
  rand enum {ADD, SUB} opcode;

  // ... methods ...
endclass

module test_randomization;
  initial begin
    AluTransaction tx = new();
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) begin
      if (tx.randomize()) begin
        tx.print();
      end
    end
  end
endmodule
```
</InteractiveCode>

## Constraints: Guiding Randomization

Purely random stimulus is good, but sometimes you need to control the randomization to create specific scenarios. This is done with **constraint blocks**.

A `constraint` block is a set of rules that the solver must follow when randomizing an object.

```systemverilog
class AluTransaction;
  rand logic [3:0] a;
  rand logic [3:0] b;
  rand enum {ADD, SUB} opcode;

  // Constraint to ensure 'a' is never zero and 'b' is less than 10
  constraint c_valid_inputs {
    a != 0;
    b < 10;
  }

  // ... methods ...
endclass
```

## Putting It All Together

This example shows the complete flow: defining a class, creating an object, constraining its randomization, and using its methods.

<InteractiveCode>
```systemverilog
// 1. Define the class blueprint
class AluTransaction;

  // Properties
  rand logic [3:0] a;
  rand logic [3:0] b;
  rand enum {ADD, SUB} opcode;

  // Constraint
  constraint c_a_not_zero { a != 0; }

  // Constructor
  function new();
    this.opcode = ADD;
  endfunction

  // Method
  function void print();
    $display("Transaction: a=%h, b=%h, opcode=%s", a, b, opcode.name());
  endfunction

endclass

// 2. Use the class in a module
module test_oop_flow;
  initial begin
    // Create a handle
    AluTransaction tx;

    // Create an object
    tx = new();

    // Randomize the object
    if (tx.randomize()) begin
      // Use the object's methods
      tx.print();
    end else begin
      $display("Randomization failed!");
    end
  end
endmodule
```
</InteractiveCode>

## The Bridge to UVM

You have just learned the fundamental pillars of UVM. The entire Universal Verification Methodology is built on SystemVerilog's OOP capabilities.
*   A UVM "sequence item" is just a SystemVerilog class that holds transaction data, like our `AluTransaction`.
*   A UVM "driver" is a class that takes these transaction objects and drives them to the DUT.
*   A UVM "test" is a class that controls which sequences of transactions are generated.

By understanding classes, objects, and randomization, you have taken the final and most important step in preparing for Tier 2 and the world of UVM.
