    "question": "What is the default value of a 4-state variable vs. a net in SystemVerilog?",
    "answer": "Variables default to 'x; nets default to 'z, making reset and drive intent visible."
  },
  {
    "id": "f2dt-2",
    "question": "When is a 2-state type like `bit` preferred over `logic`?",
    "answer": "When modeling counters, scoreboard math, or randomized fields where X/Z are not expected and simulation speed matters."
  },
  {
    "id": "f2dt-3",
    "question": "Why declare packed dimensions on the right of a signal?",
    "answer": "Packed dimensions represent contiguous bits; placing them on the right keeps bit ordering predictable and slices legal."

    "id": "f2dt-4",
    "question": "What makes queues different from dynamic arrays?",
    "answer": "Queues preserve ordering with push/pop at either end and can be bounded; dynamic arrays focus on indexed access and explicit resizing."

  {
    "id": "f2dt-5",
    "question": "How do associative arrays store data efficiently?",
    "answer": "They allocate entries only for keys that exist, making them ideal for sparse spaces like outstanding transactions or sparse address maps."
  },
  {
    "id": "f2dt-6",
    "question": "Why are enums preferable to parameters for FSM states?",
    "answer": "Enums are strongly typed, prevent accidental mixing with unrelated values, and provide iterator methods like first()/next()."
