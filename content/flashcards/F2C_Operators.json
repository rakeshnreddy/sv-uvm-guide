    "question": "When should you use case equality (`===`) instead of logical equality (`==`)?",
    "answer": "When X/Z must be preserved, such as reset checks, CDC monitoring, or X-propagation assertions."

  {
    "id": "f2c-ops-2",
    "question": "What is the key difference between `&` and `&&`?",
    "answer": "`&` is bitwise and returns a vector; `&&` is logical and returns a 1-bit true/false based on operand truthiness."
  },
  {
    "id": "f2c-ops-3",
    "question": "How does the `inside` operator treat X and Z values?",
    "answer": "It uses case-equality semantics, so X/Z must match the pattern exactly rather than being treated as don't-care."

    "id": "f2c-ops-4",
    "question": "What problem do streaming concatenations (`{<<{data}}`) solve?",
    "answer": "They reshape or serialize buses while keeping bit ordering explicit, avoiding manual slice ordering mistakes."
  },
  {
    "id": "f2c-ops-5",
    "question": "Why add parentheses around mixed operators like `a & b == c`?",
    "answer": "Because `==` has higher precedence than `&`; without parentheses the expression becomes `a & (b == c)`, which may not match intent."
