    "question": "Why do components raise objections during `run_phase`?",

    "question": "How can you allow a monitor time to flush its FIFOs after dropping objections?",
    "answer": "Set a drain time with `uvm_phase::set_drain_time` so the phase lingers briefly before ending."

    "question": "Which UVM base class participates in phasing and why?",
    "answer": "`uvm_component` doesâ€”components are structural elements that own phase callbacks, unlike `uvm_object` data classes."
