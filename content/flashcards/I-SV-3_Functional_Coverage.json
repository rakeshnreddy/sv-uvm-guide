    "id": "fc-2",
    "question": "Why define `illegal_bins`?",
    "answer": "They flag forbidden scenarios—when sampled, the simulator reports an error so you can catch spec violations immediately."
  },
  {
    "id": "fc-3",
    "question": "How do `coverpoint` crosses help?",
    "answer": "Cross coverage verifies combinations of features (e.g., command type × mode) rather than each feature independently."
  },
  {
    "id": "fc-4",
    "question": "What should you do when a bin never toggles?",
    "answer": "Investigate: confirm the scenario is reachable, update stimulus or constraints, or justify it as unreachable with an ignore bin."
