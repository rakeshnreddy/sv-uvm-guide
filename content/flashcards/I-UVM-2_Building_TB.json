    "question": "Which three components make up a typical active `uvm_agent`?",
    "answer": "A driver, a sequencer, and a monitor—active agents instantiate all three so they can generate and observe traffic." 
  },
  {
    "id": "uvm2-passive",
    "question": "When should you configure an agent as passive?",
    "answer": "Use passive agents when you only need to observe an interface—for example, system-level monitoring where another block already drives the bus."

    "id": "uvm2-handshake",
    "question": "What two method calls bookend the sequencer ↔ driver handshake for each transaction?",
    "answer": "`get_next_item()` starts the transfer by fetching the transaction, and `item_done()` signals the driver has finished driving it."

  {
    "id": "uvm2-analysis",
    "question": "How do analysis ports differ from regular TLM ports?",
    "answer": "Analysis ports broadcast transactions to every connected subscriber, enabling multiple scoreboards or coverage collectors to receive the same monitor data." 
  },
  {
    "id": "uvm2-topology",
    "question": "Why call `uvm_top.print_topology()` after building an environment?",
    "answer": "It reveals which agents and components were instantiated and how they connect—making it easy to spot missing drivers, monitors, or analysis links."
