# Analysis Report

*This document is being generated based on a comprehensive codebase audit.*

## 1. Architecture Overview

- **Framework**: Next.js 14.2.3 (App Router)
- **UI**: React 18 with TypeScript.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Radix UI for headless components and `lucide-react` for icons.
- **Data**: Prisma for database access, with `iron-session` for session management.
- **Content**: MDX served via `next-mdx-remote`, with `rehype-pretty-code` and `shiki` for syntax highlighting.
- **Testing**: Playwright for E2E tests and Vitest for unit/component tests.
- **Build Pipeline**: Standard Next.js build (`next build`) with a custom `prebuild` step (`generate:curriculum`) that suggests a static content generation process. The configuration uses an SVGR webpack loader for SVG assets.
- **Deployment**: The configuration specifies `output: 'standalone'`, which is optimized for Docker/containerized deployments.

## 2. Page & Route Inventory

The site is composed of approximately 43 routes, which can be grouped into several categories. The primary learning content is delivered via a dynamic slug-based curriculum route.

**Route Categories:**

- **Core Learning (`/curriculum`)**: The main curriculum content, served from MDX files.
- **Interactive Learning (`/practice`, `/exercises`, `/quiz`)**: A large number of pages dedicated to interactive visualizations, exercises, labs, and quizzes. These are likely candidates for performance optimization due to their complexity.
- **User & Community (Likely Mock/Future Features)**: A significant portion of the app is dedicated to user-specific and community features (`/dashboard`, `/community`, `/settings`, `/notifications`, `/history`, `/projects`, `/assessment`). These routes strongly suggest mock implementations that should be de-scoped or feature-flagged.
- **Static & Info Pages**: Standard pages like the homepage (`/`), ToS, privacy policy, etc.

**Key Routes of Interest for Performance Analysis:**

- `/curriculum/[...slug]`: The main content page. Performance here is critical.
- `/practice/visualizations/*`: These pages likely use heavy client-side dependencies like `d3` and `recharts`.
- `/practice/lab/[labId]`: These pages may load complex, interactive components like the Monaco editor.

## 3. Performance Profile

Initial analysis of the codebase reveals several significant performance bottlenecks related to heavy JavaScript dependencies. These are likely the primary cause of slow page loads.

**A. Heavy Client-Side Dependencies:**

The following libraries are used extensively and are known to be large. A major focus of the optimization effort must be on isolating and lazy-loading the components that use them.

- **`@monaco-editor/react`**: The Monaco editor is a full-featured code editor and is extremely heavy (>1MB). It is used in:
  - `app/practice/lab/[labId]/LabClientPage.tsx`
  - `components/animations/AssertionBuilder.tsx`
  - `components/ui/InteractiveCode.tsx`
- **`d3`**: This powerful visualization library underpins the custom diagrams and analytics surfaces. **Update (2025-10-09):** every usage now imports only the specific modules required (e.g., `d3-selection`, `d3-scale`, `d3-force`), but the aggregate payload of these features should still be monitored via bundle analysis.
- **`recharts`**: A charting library used for various animations and charts. Its functionality overlaps with `d3`, indicating redundancy.

**B. Problematic Import Patterns:**

- **`d3` Whole-Library Import**: *(Resolved 2025-10-09)* The codebase previously used the monolithic `import * as d3` pattern, forcing the entire library into each bundle. Imports now target the precise modules needed, enabling tree-shaking while preserving the existing functionality.

**C. Component-Level Hotspots:**

- **`components/ui/InteractiveCode.tsx`**: This component imports `@monaco-editor/react` alongside several D3 helpers. After the modularization work it now pulls only the specific helpers (`d3-selection`, `d3-scale`, etc.), but it remains a good candidate for continued lazy-loading and performance scrutiny. **Update (2025-10-10):** The shell now swaps between dark- and light-mode background/border tokens so the layout matches the design system and the theming E2E spec locks in the contrast expectations.
- **Visualization Components**: The majority of files in `src/components/diagrams`, `src/components/animations`, and `src/components/charts` import `d3` or `recharts`. These are prime candidates for dynamic loading via `next/dynamic`.
- **Mock Feature Components**: Several heavy components are tied to mock/future features that have been marked for removal or flagging. This provides a quick win for performance.
  - `components/assessment/ProgressAnalytics.tsx` (uses `d3`)
  - `components/assessment/SkillMatrixVisualizer.tsx` (uses `d3`)
  - `components/charts/HistoryTimelineChart.tsx` (uses `recharts`)
  - `components/gamification/EngagementEngine.tsx` (uses `recharts`)

## 4. Local Dev Findings

The user has reported that "navigating the site locally is difficult." The E2E test run has confirmed this and revealed the root causes: a broken developer environment setup and critical application-level bugs.

**A. Incomplete Test Environment Setup:**

- The Playwright E2E tests were un-runnable out-of-the-box because the necessary browser binaries were not installed. This requires a manual `npx playwright install` command.
- **Finding:** This missing setup step is a primary contributor to a painful developer experience, as a core verification mechanism is broken from the start.

**B. Critical Application Errors (revealed by E2E tests):**

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Failures**: The application fails to render several pages on the server due to a `ReferenceError: window is not defined`. This error originates in the `InteractiveCode.tsx` component, which is being incorrectly executed in a Node.js environment. This causes curriculum pages to return a 500 Internal Server Error. **Update (2025-10-09):** Exercise helpers now define their `instructionId` constants ahead of usage, removing a TDZ runtime crash when the lazy-loaded widgets mount, but the broader SSR audit remains open.
- **MDX Content Errors**: At least one curriculum page fails to build due to a syntax error in an MDX file (`Could not parse expression with acorn`).
- **Brittle Tests**: The vast majority of E2E tests fail due to non-unique locators (`strict mode violation`). This makes the entire test suite unreliable and unable to provide a clear signal on application health. **Update (2025-10-09):** Exercise flows now assert against refreshed copy (`Shuffle Again`, `Reset Board`, contextual score messaging), reducing false negatives once the Playwright runtime is restored.

**Conclusion:**
The local development experience is broken due to a combination of missing setup documentation and severe application-level bugs that prevent core parts of the site (the curriculum pages) from rendering. Fixing the SSR and content errors is the highest priority.

## 5. Mock / Future Features Map

The codebase contains a significant number of routes and components that are placeholders for future functionality. These provide little to no current learning value and contribute to codebase complexity and performance issues. See `docs/Learning-First-Audit.md` for a full breakdown.

**Identified Mock Features:**

- **Community Platform**: Includes user profiles, posts, and comments. (Routes: `/community/**`)
- **User Dashboard & Tracking**: Includes progress analytics, memory hub, and notebooks. (Routes: `/dashboard/**`, `/history`, `/assessment`)
- **User Account Management**: Includes settings, notifications, and profile pages. (Routes: `/settings`, `/notifications`)

**Recommendation:**
These features should be disabled by default using feature flags as outlined in `docs/De-scope-Proposal.md` and task `[L3]`.

## 6. Dependency Audit

A review of `package.json` reveals several dependencies that are likely major contributors to bundle size and should be investigated for replacement or lazy-loading.

**Heavy Dependencies of Concern:**

| Dependency                  | Version      | Size (Est.) | Notes                                                                                             |
| --------------------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@monaco-editor/react`      | `^4.7.0`     | > 1MB       | A full code editor. Must be lazy-loaded with `next/dynamic`.                                      |
| `d3`                        | `^7.9.0`     | ~150KB+     | Powerful but large visualization library. Tree-shaking can be ineffective.                        |
| `recharts`                  | `^3.0.2`     | ~100KB+     | Charting library. Using both `d3` and `recharts` is redundant and adds unnecessary weight.        |
| `firebase`                  | `^12.0.0`    | ~100KB+     | Can be large. Imports should be granular (e.g., `firebase/auth`) to ensure tree-shaking works. |
| `jspdf` / `pdf-lib`         | `^3.0.1`     | ~100KB+     | PDF generation clients. Should only be loaded on-demand when the feature is used.                 |
| `framer-motion` / `gsap`    | `^12.20.1`   | ~50-100KB   | Animation libraries. Can impact runtime performance and bundle size.                                |
| `shiki`                     | `^3.7.0`     | Large       | Syntax highlighter. Loaded during build-time via `rehype-pretty-code`, impacting build performance. |

**Redundant Dependencies:**

- The presence of both `d3` and `recharts` is a red flag. A single charting library should be chosen to reduce bundle size.
- `framer-motion` and `gsap` provide overlapping animation capabilities. Their usage should be rationalized.

**Version Drift & Unused Dependencies:**

- A full audit with `depcheck` is recommended to find unused dependencies.
- Versions seem relatively modern, but a `npm outdated` check should be part of routine maintenance.

**Key Recommendation:**

The highest priority is to locate where these heavy dependencies are used and ensure they are loaded only when needed, using techniques like `next/dynamic` for components and on-demand imports for utility libraries.
