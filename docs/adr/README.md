# Architecture Decision Records

The ADRs in this folder capture the platform decisions that drive the SV/UVM Guide. Each record is lightweight and searchableâ€”add new ones when you make a decision that changes how we build, operate, or extend the product.

| [0003](0003-asset-strategy.md) | Managed Static Assets And Bundle Guardrails | Accepted |

Create the next record by copying the existing pattern, incrementing the ID, and documenting the context, decision, consequences, and follow-up actions.
