# Learning-First Audit

This audit categorizes all application routes to align with the "Learning-First" primary objective. The goal is to identify and prioritize core learning content while de-scoping or feature-flagging non-essential features like mock community and user-specific tracking elements.

| Route                               | Learning Outcome                                                              | Must-have content | Nice-to-have (later) | Mock/Remove/Flag                               |
