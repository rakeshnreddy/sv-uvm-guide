# RTL and Testbench Constructs

SystemVerilog provides a variety of constructs for modeling both Register-Transfer Level (RTL) design and testbench components.

## Modules and Hierarchy

*   **Modules** are the basic building blocks of a SystemVerilog design. They are used to encapsulate a piece of functionality and to create a hierarchical design.
*   **Interfaces** are used to bundle related signals into a single, reusable port. This makes it easier to connect modules together and to create clean, modular designs.
*   **Modports** are used within an interface to define directionality from the perspective of the connecting module.

## Packages and Compilation Scopes

*   **Packages** are used to group related declarations, such as classes, functions, and tasks. This helps to organize your code and to prevent naming conflicts.
*   **Compilation scopes** determine the visibility of declarations. SystemVerilog has a variety of compilation scopes, including global, package, and local.

## Program and Clocking Blocks

*   **Program blocks** are used to separate the testbench from the DUT. They are executed in their own region of the event schedule, which helps to prevent race conditions.
*   **Clocking blocks** are used to define a set of signals that are synchronous to a specific clock. This ensures that the testbench samples DUT outputs and drives DUT inputs at predictable times relative to the clock edge, eliminating timing hazards.
