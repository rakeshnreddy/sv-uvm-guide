# SystemVerilog and UVM Learning Platform

**Vision:** To be the world's leading open-source, curriculum-based guide for SystemVerilog and UVM.

This repository provides a structured and comprehensive curriculum for learning SystemVerilog and the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM). Our goal is to create a platform that is accessible to beginners, yet deep enough for experienced engineers to hone their skills.

## Curriculum Architecture

The curriculum is organized into a four-tiered structure, based on the principle of progressive disclosure. Each tier builds upon the previous one, creating a clear learning path from foundational concepts to expert-level techniques.

*   **Tier 1: Foundational (T1_Foundational):** Core concepts of the SystemVerilog language.
*   **Tier 2: Intermediate (T2_Intermediate):** Advanced SystemVerilog and core UVM concepts.
*   **Tier 3: Advanced (T3_Advanced):** Advanced UVM techniques and patterns.
*   **Tier 4: Expert (T4_Expert):** Expert-level topics, including performance, debug, and methodology customization.
