# The SystemVerilog & UVM Guide

**Vision:** To be the world's leading open-source, curriculum-based guide for SystemVerilog and the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM).

This repository provides a comprehensive, structured curriculum for learning SystemVerilog and UVM, guiding users from foundational principles to expert-level application.

## The Four-Tiered Curriculum

The curriculum is organized into four tiers, providing a clear, progressive learning pathway.

*   **Tier 1: The Foundational Bedrock:** For absolute beginners, establishing a solid understanding of functional verification and basic SystemVerilog.
*   **Tier 2: The Intermediate Practitioner:** For those with some HDL experience, focusing on key SystemVerilog features for verification and core UVM concepts.
*   **Tier 3: The Advanced Architect:** For experienced engineers, mastering the art of architecting robust, reusable, and scalable UVM environments.
*   **Tier 4: The Domain Expert:** For principal engineers and architects, covering specialized, high-impact techniques and strategic topics.

A comprehensive map of all modules can be found in the [Comprehensive Curriculum Module Map](enhance.md#table-211-comprehensive-curriculum-module-map).

## Start Here

If you are new to hardware verification, we recommend starting with the first module of Tier 1:
