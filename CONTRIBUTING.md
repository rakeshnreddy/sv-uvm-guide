# Contributing to the SystemVerilog and UVM Learning Platform

First off, thank you for considering contributing. It's people like you that make this platform such a great resource.

## Project Vision & Pedagogy

Our vision is to be the world's leading open-source, curriculum-based guide for SystemVerilog and UVM. To achieve this, we adhere to five core pedagogical principles:

*   **Progressive Disclosure:** Introduce concepts in a logical order, building on previous knowledge.
*   **Context is King:** Explain the "why" before the "how."
*   **Code-First:** Every concept should be illustrated with a minimal, complete, compilable, and executable code example.
*   **Why before How:** Explain the purpose of a concept before diving into the implementation details.
*   **Active Learning:** Encourage learning by doing, with hands-on labs and exercises.

## Content Style Guide

*   **Tone:** Authoritative but accessible.
*   **Text Formatting:** Use Markdown for all content.
*   **Code Style:** Follow industry-standard SystemVerilog and UVM formatting conventions.
