# Contributing to the SystemVerilog & UVM Guide

First off, thank you for considering contributing! This project is maintained by a community of volunteers, and we are grateful for every contribution, from fixing a typo to writing a new module.

This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project. Please read it carefully to ensure that the contribution process is smooth for both you and the project maintainers.

## Project Vision & Pedagogy

Our vision is to be the world's leading open-source, curriculum-based guide for SystemVerilog and UVM. To achieve this, we adhere to five core pedagogical principles. All contributions must align with this philosophy.

1.  **Progressive Disclosure:** Content is structured in tiers to prevent cognitive overload. Concepts are introduced logically and gradually.
2.  **Context is King:** No concept is introduced in isolation. Every topic is framed within its broader verification context.
3.  **Code-First Pedagogy:** Every theoretical concept is accompanied by a minimal, complete, compilable, and executable code example.
4.  **The "Why" Before the "How":** Before explaining the mechanics of a feature, we first explain the problem that the feature solves.
5.  **Active Learning:** We encourage active engagement through practical labs, quizzes, and a running project that evolves with the learner.

## Content Style Guide

To ensure a consistent user experience, all content must adhere to the following style guidelines:

*   **Tone:** Authoritative but accessible. The tone should be that of a knowledgeable and helpful mentor.
*   **Text Formatting:** Use Markdown for all content. Keep formatting simple and consistent.
*   **Code Style:** All SystemVerilog and UVM code must follow a consistent style. We recommend following industry-standard practices for readability and maintainability.

## Contribution Workflow

We follow a standard GitHub fork-and-pull-request workflow.

1.  **Find an Issue:** All work should be tied to an existing issue in the issue tracker. If you want to work on something that doesn't have an issue, please create one first to discuss the proposed change.
2.  **Fork the Repository:** Create a fork of the repository to your own GitHub account.
3.  **Create a Feature Branch:** Create a new branch in your fork for your contribution. Name the branch descriptively (e.g., `feature/add-axi-vip` or `fix/typo-in-readme`).
4.  **Make Your Changes:** Make your changes in your feature branch. Ensure that your changes adhere to the style guide and pedagogical principles.
5.  **Submit a Pull Request:** When you are ready, submit a pull request from your feature branch to the `main` branch of the main repository. The pull request description should clearly explain the changes you have made and link to the issue it resolves.

## Definition of Done

For a contribution to be merged, it must meet the following criteria:

*   **Technically Accurate:** The content must be factually correct.
*   **Includes Code Example:** For new concepts, at least one minimal, complete, compilable, and executable code example must be included.
*   **Follows "Why before How":** The contribution must explain the problem before presenting the solution.
*   **Includes Key Takeaways:** A summary of the key learning points must be included.
*   **Reviewed and Approved:** The pull request must be reviewed and approved by at least one designated SME (Subject Matter Expert) or project maintainer.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project. We look forward to your contributions!
