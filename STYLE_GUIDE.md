# Style Guide

This document outlines the content and formatting conventions for the SystemVerilog & UVM Guide. Following these guidelines ensures a consistent and high-quality learning experience for all users.

## Content Formatting

### Headings

-   **H1 (`#`)**: Reserved for the main page title (auto-generated).
-   **H2 (`##`)**: Used for major sections within a page (e.g., "Level 1: The Elevator Pitch", "Core Mechanics").
-   **H3 (`###`)**: Used for sub-sections within a major section (e.g., "The Role of SystemVerilog and UVM").
-   **H4 (`####`)**: Used for specific examples or points within a sub-section.

### Text Formatting

-   **Bold (`**text**`)**: Use for key terms and concepts on their first appearance. Also used for UI elements like button names.
-   **Italics (`*text*`)**: Use for emphasis or for introducing a new term that is not a key concept.
-   **Code (` `code` `)**: Use for all SystemVerilog keywords, data types, variable names, and code snippets.

### Analogies and Examples

-   **Analogies**: Use the "The Analogy:" prefix in bold.
-   **Examples**: Use the "A Simple Example:" prefix in bold.

## Interactive Components

-   **`<Quiz>`**: Use to check for understanding after a major concept has been explained.
-   **`<Flashcard>`**: Use to reinforce key definitions.
-   **`<DragAndDropExercise>`**: Use for exercises that involve ordering or matching concepts.

## Code Blocks

-   All code blocks should have the correct language identifier (e.g., ` ```systemverilog`).
-   All code examples should be complete and runnable, or clearly marked as a snippet.

## Call-out Boxes

-   **`<Note>`**: Use for tips, tricks, and additional information that is helpful but not critical to the main topic.
-   **`<Warning>`**: Use for important information that could cause confusion or errors if not followed.
-   **`<Danger>`**: Use for critical information that could lead to significant problems, such as data loss or incorrect simulation results.
