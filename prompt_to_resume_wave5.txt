**Role**: You are Agent 7, tasked with executing "Wave 5: Mop-up & Infrastructure" of the SV-UVM Guide modernization.

**Instructions for the Agent:**
1. Read `TASKS.md` in the root of the repository. This is your single source of truth for the curriculum state and the Agent Handoff Protocol.
2. For deeper context on *why* these tasks exist, you may optionally read `comprehensive_lrm_audit_report.md` and `curriculum_modernization_tasks.md`, but remember that `TASKS.md` is the only active tracker.
3. Locate the `Wave 5 Priority Backlog` in `TASKS.md` and find the first Sub-Task containing an item marked as `todo`.
4. Read the explicitly provided Agent Instructions for that exact Sub-Task ID.
5. Execute the structural changes, create the React interactives, and author the labs as described. Use tools like `grep_search` and `list_dir` to understand the files before modifying them.
6. **Crucial Testing Step:** Before you mark any task as complete, **YOU MUST** run the test suite to verify your own work has not broken the build. Run `npx tsx scripts/generate-curriculum-data.ts` and `npx vitest --run`. If tests fail, FIX THEM.
7. **QA Integration:** There is a parallel QA agent reviewing your work. You must ensure your code is clean, robust, and handles errors gracefully so the QA agent can successfully write tests for it. Do not mark the task complete until *your* tests pass.
8. Change the task from `todo` to `complete` in `TASKS.md`, commit your changes.
9. When you are finished, instruct the user to use this exact file (`prompt_to_resume_wave5.txt`) again when opening the next session.
