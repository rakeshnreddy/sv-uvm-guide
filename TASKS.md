# Next Action Tracker

This file consolidates open implementation and feedback items so the team has a single queue to reference between sessions. Update the status column as items progress and prune tasks once they are delivered.

## Status Legend
- `todo`: Not started.
- `in-progress`: Work underway or partially delivered.
- `blocked`: Waiting on another task or external dependency.
- `ready-for-review`: Awaiting verification/approval.

## Active Tasks
| ID | Status | Area | Summary | Notes |
|----|--------|------|---------|-------|
| `VIS-3D-MAILBOX` | `todo` | Visualizations | Build 3D mailbox vs queue arbitration scene showing head/tail pressure and outstanding transactions. | Mirror queue semantics and highlight backpressure cues before integrating into Practice. |
| `VIS-3D-COVERAGE` | `todo` | Visualizations | Create 3D coverage bin heat-map towers to illustrate sampling progress over time. | Reuse coverage data from Coverage Analyzer to drive bar heights and color intensity. |
| `VIS-3D-ANALYSIS` | `todo` | Visualizations | Model UVM analysis fan-out as a layered 3D lattice linking monitors, scoreboards, and subscribers. | Should pair with component relationships lesson to emphasize TLM connections. |
| `VIS-3D-DATAFLOW` | `todo` | Visualizations | Build a 3D UVM data-flow pipeline that traces transactions from sequencer to driver to monitor to scoreboard. | Include animated arrows and latency cues to highlight hand-offs across TLM ports. |
| `VIS-3D-CONSTRAINT` | `todo` | Visualizations | Prototype a 3D constraint solver state tree that highlights active branches during randomize() calls. | Use branching transparency to depict pruned paths and constraint weighting. |
| `VIS-3D-PHASE-TIMELINE` | `todo` | Visualizations | Animate phase timelines in 3D to show overlapping run/cleanup windows across components. | Could extend the blocking simulator with depth to convey phasing concurrency. |
