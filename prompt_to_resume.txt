# Resume SV/UVM Guide Session

Status updates:
- `VIS-1` is complete. `DataTypeComparisonChart` now renders card-style SVG glyphs that teach state space, driver resolution, and usage context for logic/wire/reg/bit (no more generic grouped bars), adapts to single-column layouts on smaller screens, and respects dark mode theming.
- `PROD-1` is complete. `/quiz/placement` now runs a ten-question interactive assessment with weighted scoring, tier recommendations, category analytics, and deep-link resource suggestions.
- `PROD-2` is complete. Notifications now flow from the engagement API + preference model, the navbar dropdown shows live activity summaries, and `/notifications` renders real data with preference snapshots (plus a new unit suite around the generator).
- `PROD-3` is complete. `/settings` loads/saves session-backed preferences (theme, notification cadence/categories, telemetry), the navbar feed honors those toggles, and a dedicated `/api/preferences` route handles persistence with new unit coverage.
- Added focused tests: new unit suites for notification/user preference merging, API route coverage (`tests/api/preferences.test.ts`), and a client-side interaction test for `SettingsPageClient`. Authored a Playwright spec (`tests/e2e/account-preferences.spec.ts`) that exercises `/settings`, `/notifications`, and the navbar feed when account UI flags are enabled. Updated `/history` to respect user telemetry preferences and adjusted `visualizations.spec.ts` to assert the fallback when tracking is off.
- Latest checks: `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, and `npm run build` all pass with the updated notification + settings plumbing. Targeted Playwright run for `tests/e2e/account-preferences.spec.ts` succeeds locally with `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_FLAG_ACCOUNT_UI=true`; sandbox environments still block binding to localhost, so CI runs should execute on a machine with the port opened.

Outstanding focus areas:
- `OPS-1` closed: Playwright now launches Next on port 3100 with only the account UI flag (`playwright.config.ts`). Verified locally with `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_FLAG_ACCOUNT_UI=true npx playwright test --reporter=line,html`.
- `OPS-2` closed: latest HTML report archived at `test-results/playwright-10_8/`â€”attach to Milestone 4 when sharing status.
- Evaluate bundling impact of the new preferences module once browser cache clears (run `npm run bundle:check`).
- Remaining curriculum visuals rely on bespoke D3 or animation-driven diagrams; no legacy bar charts found outside the updated data-type comparison.

Next session suggestions:
1. Review bundle budgets (`npm run bundle:check`) after any major visual or preference updates.
2. Consider adding mobile viewport Playwright coverage for the notification dropdown when the device matrix expands.
