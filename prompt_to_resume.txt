You’re picking up the SV/UVM guide right after shipping the “navigation + personalization polish” work (see master commit history for
  October 7, 2025). The homepage now consumes /api/engagement/:userId, the hero CTA points to a real placement quiz landing page, and footer
  policy links no longer 404. Planning docs (MASTER_PLAN.md, TODO.md) are current as of that push.

  Where to start

  - Review the just-added stubs so you understand the launch points:
      - Placement quiz landing page: src/app/quiz/placement/page.tsx
      - Settings MVP: src/app/settings/page.tsx
      - Notifications inbox: src/app/notifications/page.tsx
  - Re-read the updated roadmap sections:
      - TODO.md → “Navigation & Experience Polish” (shipped) and “Next Focus Candidates” (your backlog).
      - MASTER_PLAN.md → status snapshot + changelog entry for 2025‑10‑07.

  Current status

  - Homepage personalization is live but relies on fallback analytics; no production data connectors or saved preferences yet.
  - Notifications/settings routes are static placeholders (copy only; no persistence).
  - Placement quiz page is informational—the interactive assessment still lives in the old assessment flow.
  - Tier status mix: T2 complete, T1 in review, T3/T4 mostly draft (see src/lib/curriculum-status.ts for details).

  Next development goals

  1. Interactive placement quiz
      - Build question bank, scoring, and analytics instrumentation.
      - Wire the CTA on /quiz/placement to the actual experience (extend /assessment or create a fresh flow).
  2. Real notifications
      - Replace the static inbox with data pulled from engagement events.
      - Add per-user preference toggles and persistence.
  3. Settings persistence
      - Hook the appearance/notification controls in src/app/settings/page.tsx to stored user preferences (consider session | Firestore stub).

  Validate with npm run lint, npm run type-check, and targeted Vitest suites (tests/lib/personalization.test.ts, any new quiz/notification
  tests). Treat the “Next Focus Candidates” section as the sprint backlog and keep MASTER_PLAN.md’s changelog in sync as you land work.
