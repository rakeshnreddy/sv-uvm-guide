# Resume SV/UVM Guide Session

Status updates:
- `VIS-1` is complete. `DataTypeComparisonChart` now renders card-style SVG glyphs that teach state space, driver resolution, and usage context for logic/wire/reg/bit (no more generic grouped bars), adapts to single-column layouts on smaller screens, and respects dark mode theming.
- `PROD-1` is complete. `/quiz/placement` now runs a ten-question interactive assessment with weighted scoring, tier recommendations, category analytics, and deep-link resource suggestions.
- `PROD-2` is complete. Notifications now flow from the engagement API + preference model, the navbar dropdown shows live activity summaries, and `/notifications` renders real data with preference snapshots (plus a new unit suite around the generator).
- `PROD-3` is complete. `/settings` loads/saves session-backed preferences (theme, notification cadence/categories, telemetry), the navbar feed honors those toggles, and a dedicated `/api/preferences` route handles persistence with new unit coverage.
- Added focused tests: new unit suites for notification/user preference merging, API route coverage (`tests/api/preferences.test.ts`), and a client-side interaction test for `SettingsPageClient`. Authored a Playwright spec (`tests/e2e/account-preferences.spec.ts`) that exercises `/settings`, `/notifications`, and the navbar feed when account UI flags are enabled.
- Latest checks: `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, and `npm run build` all pass with the updated notification + settings plumbing. Targeted Playwright run for the new spec failed to start the dev server (`EPERM` binding port 3000) due to the existing OPS-1 environment restriction.

Outstanding focus areas:
- `OPS-1` still blocks Playwright system deps; the new account-preferences e2e should be re-run locally once the server can bind, then capture the resulting report for `OPS-2`.
- Evaluate bundling impact of the new preferences module once browser cache clears (should be minimal, but monitor `npm run bundle:check` on next pass).
- Remaining curriculum visuals rely on bespoke D3 or animation-driven diagrams; no legacy bar charts found outside the updated data-type comparison.

Next session suggestions:
1. Resolve `OPS-1` (install browser deps / allow server binding) so the Playwright suite—including `tests/e2e/account-preferences.spec.ts`—can run and produce the report needed for `OPS-2`.
2. Audit notification UX for mobile breakpoints and add any missing assertions once full Playwright coverage is available.
