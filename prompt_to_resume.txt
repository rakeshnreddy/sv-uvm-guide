You are an expert SystemVerilog/UVM instructor, UX/UI designer, and web developer.
Your goal is to continue the comprehensive "Curriculum Modernization" of the SV-UVM Guide, transforming it into a world-class, premium, and highly interactive learning platform that prepares engineers for both real-world work and rigorous technical interviews.

**Context (Current State):**
- **T1 Foundational Modules (F1, F2, F3, F4):** Modernized and split into A/B/C/D sub-modules. Interactive components like `OperatorDrill` and `EventRegionScheduler` are live.
- **Critical Oversight:** The legacy `F2_Data_Types_and_Structures` folder is STILL present alongside the new F2A/F2B/F2C folders, causing redundancy in `curriculum-data.tsx`.
- **T2 (Intermediate), T3 (Advanced), T4 (Expert):** Un-modernized. These currently exist as monolithic, text-heavy blocks (e.g., `I-SV-2_Constrained_Randomization`).
- **Aesthetic & Pedagogy Baseline:** Good, but needs elevation. The site must deliver premium aesthetics (animations, typography, interactive layouts) and a relentless focus on "interview and workplace readiness" through deep-dive visual playgrounds, not just text.

**Current Objective:**
Address the "Fresh Eyes Audit Feedback" and begin modernizing T2 (Intermediate) SystemVerilog constraints and OOP concepts, while fixing leftover T1 tech debt.

**Next Steps & Implementation Details:**

1.  **Immediate Cleanup (Tech Debt):**
    -   Delete the redundant `content/curriculum/T1_Foundational/F2_Data_Types_and_Structures` directory.
    -   Delete `F5_Intro_to_OOP_in_SV` (if it exists, as OOP should reside entirely in T2).
    -   Run `scripts/generate-curriculum-data.ts`, `vitest`, and playwright to ensure everything is green.

2.  **Elevate Learning & Interview Readiness (Component Creation):**
    -   Design and build a premium, highly interactive `InterviewQuestionPlayground.tsx` component. It should present tricky SV/UVM edge cases, allow the user to guess the outcome, and then animate/visually explain the correct answer.
    -   Build a `ConstraintSolverVisualizer.tsx` (or similar "Hero" interactive) for the upcoming Constrained Randomization chapters. It should allow users to toggle soft/hard constraints and visually see the valid solution space shrink/expand.

3.  **Modernize T2 (Intermediate) - SystemVerilog OOP & Constraints:**
    -   Apply the A/B/C split methodology to `I-SV-1_OOP` and `I-SV-2_Constrained_Randomization`. Break them into digestible, focused micro-lessons.
    -   Integrate the `InterviewQuestionPlayground` and `ConstraintSolverVisualizer` into these newly split chapters.
    -   Ensure all new client components have the `'use client'` directive to prevent SSR crashes.

4.  **Verification & Polish:**
    -   Update `src/lib/curriculum-status.ts` and `TASKS.md` with your progress.
    -   Ensure perfect aesthetic execution: smooth transitions, no layout shift, and intuitive UX.
    -   Ensure all E2E and unit tests pass.

**Important Files:**
-   `curriculum_audit_feedback.md` (Read this first for the full brutal analysis)
-   `src/lib/curriculum-status.ts`
-   `TASKS.md`
-   `prompt_to_resume.txt`
