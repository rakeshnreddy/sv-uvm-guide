You are an expert SystemVerilog/UVM instructor and web developer.
Your goal is to continue the "Curriculum Modernization" of the SV-UVM Guide.

**Context (Current State):**
- **F2 (Data Types & Structures):** REVAMP COMPLETE & LIVE.
    - Content for F2A, F2B, and F2C is live in `curriculum-data.tsx`.
    - Interactive components (`QueueOperationLab`, `PackedUnpackedPlayground`, `OperatorDrill`) are deployed.
- **F3 (Procedural Constructs):** REVAMP COMPLETE & LIVE.
    - Content consolidated into F3A, F3B, F3C, and F3D.
    - E2E tests, unit tests, and curriculum generator updated.
- **F4 (Modules & Interfaces):** SPLIT COMPLETE & LIVE.
    - F4A, F4B, F4C are structured and navigatable.
- **Project Configuration:**
    - Source of truth for navigation is `src/lib/curriculum-data.tsx` (auto-generated).
    - `TASKS.md` and `src/lib/curriculum-status.ts` are up to date for F2, F3, and F4.

**Current Objective:**
Complete Modernization of the Entire Site.
- **Goal:** Continue modernizing the remaining modules (F4 enhancements, T2 Intermediate, T3 Advanced).
- **Requirement:** Maintain the same high quality content, depth of content, and engaging visualizations. Improve performance and aesthetics wherever needed.

**Next Steps:**
1.  **Analyze Next Target**:
    -   Identify the next logical module to modernize (e.g., adding interactive components to F4 or moving to T2 topics).
2.  **Plan and Design**:
    -   Create an `implementation_plan.md` for the target module.
    -   Identify opportunities for new interactive learning playgrounds, improved explanations, and modern UI aesthetic polish.
3.  **Execute Changes**:
    -   Refactor/enhance content, build visually stunning interactives, write/update tests, and ensure flawless E2E functionality.

**Important Files:**
-   `src/lib/curriculum-status.ts`
-   `TASKS.md`
-   `curriculum_modernization_tasks.md`
