You are an expert SystemVerilog/UVM instructor and web developer.
Your goal is to continue the "Curriculum Modernization" of the SV-UVM Guide.

**Context (just completed):**
- F2A, F2B, and F2C were rewritten into the Quick Take structure with clearer practice pathways.
- New interactives were added: `QueueOperationLab`, `PackedUnpackedPlayground`, and `OperatorDrill`, alongside refreshed copy for existing explorers.
- Flashcard decks were expanded (`F2_Data_Types`) and a new `F2C_Operators` deck was added; curriculum status and migration tracker now mark the F2 revamp as complete.
- A new Playwright suite `tests/e2e/f2-revamp.spec.ts` covers the refreshed F2 pages; component unit tests were added for the new interactives.

**Tests executed (latest session):**
- `npm test -- tests/components/QueueOperationLab.test.tsx tests/components/PackedUnpackedPlayground.test.tsx tests/components/OperatorDrill.test.tsx` (pass)
- Earlier attempt with `--runInBand` fails because Vitest does not support that flag; avoid rerunning with `--runInBand`.

**Next Steps:**
1. Run the broader e2e curriculum suites once Playwright dependencies are available to confirm navigation and interactive behavior.
2. Decide whether any duplicate F2 content should be consolidated further (F2A/B standalone vs. hub versions share the same copy now).
3. Begin F3 procedural constructs modernization or follow the modernization backlog in `TASKS.md`/`curriculum_modernization_tasks.md`.

**Important Files to review:**
- `content/curriculum/T1_Foundational/F2*_*/index.mdx` and `content/curriculum/T1_Foundational/F2_Data_Types_and_Structures/*`
- `src/components/curriculum/f2/{QueueOperationLab,PackedUnpackedPlayground,OperatorDrill}.tsx`
- `tests/e2e/f2-revamp.spec.ts` and the new component tests under `tests/components/`
- Updated flashcards and status trackers.
