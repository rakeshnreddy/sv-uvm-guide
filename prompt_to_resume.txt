You are an expert SystemVerilog/UVM instructor and web developer.
Your goal is to continue the "Curriculum Modernization" of the SV-UVM Guide.

**Context (Current State):**
- **F2 (Data Types & Structures):** REVAMP COMPLETE & LIVE.
    - Content for F2A, F2B, and F2C is live in `curriculum-data.tsx`.
    - Interactive components (`QueueOperationLab`, `PackedUnpackedPlayground`, `OperatorDrill`) are deployed.
- **F4 (Modules & Interfaces):** SPLIT COMPLETE & LIVE.
    - F4A, F4B, F4C are structured and navigatable.
- **Project Configuration:**
    - Source of truth for navigation is `src/lib/curriculum-data.tsx` (auto-generated).
    - `_category_.json` files appear to be legacy/unused by the current build script (`scripts/generate-curriculum-data.ts`), but are stale.
    - `TASKS.md` is significantly out of date.

**Current Objective:**
F3: Procedural Constructs Modernization.
- **Current Content:** `F3_Procedural_Constructs` (Procedural Blocks), `F3D_Interprocess_Communication` (Semaphores/Mailboxes), `F3E_System_Tasks_and_File_IO`.
- **Goal:** Review, modernize, and potentially consolidate these into a cohesive structure similar to F1/F2/F4.
- **Status:** `curriculum-status.ts` marks F3 as 'in-review' (last updated Sep 2025), necessitating a refresh to match Nov 2025 standards.

**Next Steps:**
1.  **Project Tracking Cleanup**:
    -   Update `curriculum-status.ts` to reflect the true state of F2/F4.
    -   Update `TASKS.md` to prune completed items (F2/F4 splits).
    -   (Optional) Delete or update `_category_.json` files if they are truly unused to avoid confusion.
2.  **F3 Modernization Plan**:
    -   Analyze F3*, F3D, F3E content for overlap and flow.
    -   Create an `implementation_plan.md` for F3 modernization (consolidate into F3A/B/C or keep separate?).
    -   Identify missing interactive opportunities for F3.
3.  **Execute F3 Changes**:
    -   Refactor content, add interactives, update tests.

**Important Files:**
-   `content/curriculum/T1_Foundational/F3*`
-   `src/lib/curriculum-status.ts`
-   `TASKS.md`
