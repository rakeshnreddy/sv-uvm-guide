**SV/UVM Guide – Resume Notes**

**Completed in Previous Session**
- Resolved the SSR crash by deferring all Monaco/`window` usage inside `InteractiveCode`, unblocking curriculum page rendering ([D1]).
- Fixed the MDX syntax issue in `content/curriculum/T3_Advanced/A-UVM-1_Advanced_Sequencing/index.mdx` so markdown parsing no longer fails ([D2]).
- Documented local setup in the README, added Firebase placeholders to `.env.example`, and wired `npx playwright install` into `postinstall` to keep E2E tests runnable ([D3]).
- Re-organized the `docs` directory to create a clear separation between `planning` and `feedback` documents.

**Current Status**
- Milestone 3 (Stabilize) is complete: curriculum pages render again and the local dev checklist is up to date.
- The `docs` directory has been restructured for better organization. Planning and feedback documents are now in `docs/planning` and `docs/feedback` respectively.
- `npm run type-check` passes; Playwright binaries install automatically during `npm install`.
- E2E tests still fail due to brittle locators (`strict mode violations`)—addressed later in Milestone 4.

**Next Objectives**
1. Begin Milestone 1 (Learning-First & Scaffolding):
   - [L1] Build `docs/feedback/Learning-First-Audit.md` by auditing every route listed in the Page & Route Inventory.
   - [L2] Introduce `src/tools/featureFlags.ts` with the specified default-off flags and an `isFeatureEnabled` helper.
   - [L3] Gate mock UI routes/components behind the new flags (e.g., dashboard, community, history) returning placeholders or `notFound()` when disabled.
2. After L1–L3, proceed to Milestone 1 maintenance tasks [M1-1] and [M1-2] (enforce TS/ESLint in builds) before touching Milestone 2 or 4 work.

**How to Get Started**
- Read `docs/planning/Actionable-Task-Plan.md` for the step-by-step backlog.
- Refer to the `docs/feedback` directory for analysis and audit reports.
- Verify the dev environment: `npm install` (installs Playwright) → `npm run dev` to spot regressions → `npm run type-check`.
- When tackling [L3], be methodical—introduce feature flags first, then update pages/components, and finally confirm routing behavior in the browser.

**Known Risks / Follow-ups**
- Do not resume feature roadmap items (interactive placement quiz, notifications, settings persistence) until after Milestones 1–4 are satisfied.
- E2E tests remain flaky; plan to stabilize them under Milestone 4 once the gating work is finished.
