# Resume SV/UVM Guide Session

Context:
- Latest pass replaced Recharts with D3/SVG and introduced `src/components/mdx/Image.tsx` so curriculum MDX renders `<img>` without `next/image` SSR issues.
- Playwright, Vitest, and ESLint are all passing locally (`npm run lint`, `npm run test`, `npx playwright test`).
- Outstanding backlog items to monitor: `VIS-1` (redesign curriculum bar-chart visualizations), `PROD-1`–`PROD-3`, plus `OPS-1` (Playwright system deps) and `OPS-2` (capture fresh e2e report once OPS-1 unblocks).

Key files worth scanning before continuing:
- `TASKS.md` – authoritative status table (see `VIS-1`, `OPS-1`, `OPS-2`).
- `src/components/mdx/Image.tsx` – shared MDX `<img>` wrapper used by all lessons.
- `src/components/charts/` and `src/components/animations/` – D3 implementations that replaced Recharts.
- Curriculum MDX examples: `content/curriculum/T1_Foundational/F4_RTL_and_Testbench_Constructs/index.mdx`, `content/curriculum/T2_Intermediate/I-SV-3_Functional_Coverage/index.mdx`.

When resuming:
1. Decide whether to tackle `VIS-1` (design richer curriculum visuals) or another backlog item (`PROD-*`, `OPS-2` once OPS-1 is cleared).
2. Update MDX/visual components accordingly; keep changes aligned with the new `MdxImage` wrapper and D3 chart patterns.
3. Run `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, and `npx playwright test` (ensure Playwright system deps are installed) before wrapping up.
4. Refresh `TASKS.md` and this prompt with any progress or new blockers.
