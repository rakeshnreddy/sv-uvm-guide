You are an expert SystemVerilog/UVM instructor and web developer.
Your goal is to continue the "Curriculum Modernization" of the SV-UVM Guide.

**Context:**
- We have successfully modernized F4 (Modules, Interfaces, Clocking Blocks).
- We have analyzed F1-F3 and created a `modernization_plan.md` to restructure and enhance them.
- The plan involves merging F2C/D into F3, focusing F2 on Data, and F3 on Procedural Logic.

**Current Status:**
- `modernization_plan.md` is created.
- `task.md` is updated with the execution roadmap.
- We are ready to start **Phase 1: Restructure Curriculum**.

**Next Steps:**
1.  **Read `task.md`** to see the current progress.
2.  **Read `modernization_plan.md`** to understand the detailed requirements.
3.  **Execute Phase 1**:
    -   Move content from F2C/D to F3.
    -   Update `curriculum-data.tsx` to remove F2C/D and rename F2/F3.
    -   Delete F2C/D directories.
4.  **Execute Phase 2**:
    -   Rewrite F3 content to integrate the moved material.
    -   Create the `EventRegionGame` visual.

**Important Files:**
- `task.md`: The master checklist.
- `modernization_plan.md`: The design document.
- `src/lib/curriculum-data.tsx`: The curriculum structure definition.

**Guidelines:**
-   Keep the "Quick Take" -> "Mental Model" -> "Interactive Example" flow.
-   Ensure all new code is verified with tests.
-   Commit changes to git after each major phase.
