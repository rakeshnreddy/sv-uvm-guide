# Resume SV/UVM Guide Session

Status updates:
- `VIS-1` is complete. `DataTypeComparisonChart` now renders card-style SVG glyphs that teach state space, driver resolution, and usage context for logic/wire/reg/bit (no more generic grouped bars), adapts to single-column layouts on smaller screens, and respects dark mode theming.
- `PROD-1` is complete. `/quiz/placement` now runs a ten-question interactive assessment with weighted scoring, tier recommendations, category analytics, and deep-link resource suggestions.
- Removed the stray `xmlns` attribute inside the chart's `foreignObject` to fix TypeScript build errors that previously surfaced as 500s during the curriculum e2e run.
- `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, and `npm run build` all pass after the visual and quiz updates.
- Targeted Playwright run (`tests/e2e/curriculum-links.spec.ts` on Chromium) passes when the dev server can bind locally; full suite still pending the OPS-1 environment fix.

Outstanding focus areas:
- `PROD-2`â€“`PROD-3` remain untouched.
- `OPS-1` still blocks Playwright system deps in restricted environments (port binding was the failure cause earlier). `OPS-2` (fresh e2e report) stays pending until the full suite runs post-OPS-1.
- Remaining curriculum visuals rely on bespoke D3 or animation-driven diagrams; no legacy bar charts found outside the updated data-type comparison.

Next session suggestions:
1. Revisit `OPS-1` install path so `npx playwright test` and `npm run test:e2e` can ship a fresh report for `OPS-2` once system deps are in place.
2. Start on `PROD-2` (notifications) or `PROD-3` (settings persistence) now that placement is finished.
