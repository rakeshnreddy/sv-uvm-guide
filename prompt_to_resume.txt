**Resuming work on the SV/UVM Guide.**

**Where You Left Off:**
You were previously working on the 'navigation + personalization polish' sprint. The last commit involved shipping updates to the homepage API, the placement quiz CTA, and fixing footer links. The next planned tasks were to build the interactive placement quiz, implement real notifications, and add settings persistence.

**IMPORTANT: A strategic audit has just been completed, and its findings have introduced new, higher-priority tasks that must be addressed before resuming the previous roadmap.**

**New 'Source of Truth' Documents:**
The audit has generated a new set of planning documents that now serve as your primary guide:
-   `docs/Analysis-Report.md`: The full analysis of the codebase, detailing critical bugs and performance issues. **Read this for context.**
-   `docs/Actionable-Task-Plan.md`: The detailed, step-by-step implementation plan. **This is now your primary backlog.**

These documents supersede the previous `MASTER_PLAN.md` and `TODO.md`.

**Current State & Critical Issues:**
The audit discovered that the project is **not stable**. The E2E tests are failing, blocking reliable development.
-   **Critical Bugs:** Server-Side Rendering (SSR) errors (`window is not defined`) and MDX content parsing errors are causing 500 errors on core curriculum pages.
-   **Broken Dev Environment:** The E2E test setup is incomplete (`npx playwright install` is required) and the tests themselves are brittle ("strict mode violations").

**Your Immediate Priorities (Stabilize the Application):**
Before resuming any feature work, you **must** stabilize the application. Begin with the tasks in **Milestone 3** of the `Actionable-Task-Plan.md`:

1.  **[D1] Fix SSR `window is not defined` Error.**
2.  **[D2] Fix MDX Content Parsing Error.**
3.  **[D3] Document and Automate Local Development Setup.**

**The Path Forward:**

1.  **Stabilize (Now):** Complete all tasks in Milestone 3 of the task plan.
2.  **Optimize (Next):** Proceed with Milestones 1 and 2 (gating mock features, optimizing performance).
3.  **Maintain (Then):** Work on Milestone 4 (fixing brittle tests, etc.).
4.  **Resume Feature Work (Later):** Once the codebase is stable and optimized, the previous roadmap goals (interactive quiz, real notifications, etc.) can be re-evaluated and prioritized.

**Getting Started:**
1.  Thoroughly read `docs/Actionable-Task-Plan.md`.
2.  Begin implementation with task `[D1]`.
