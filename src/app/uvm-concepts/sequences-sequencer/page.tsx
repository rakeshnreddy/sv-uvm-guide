  const level1Content = (
    <>
      <p><strong>What is it?</strong> [Placeholder: Clear definition of UVM sequences for generating streams of transactions, and the sequencer's role as an arbiter and forwarder of these transactions to the driver, from blueprint].</p>
      <p><strong>The Analogy:</strong> [Placeholder: Analogy for sequences/sequencer, e.g., "Think of sequences as 'screenplays' for data generation, sequence items as 'lines of dialogue', and the sequencer as the 'director' choosing which actor (sequence) gets to deliver their lines to the driver (the main actor on stage)," from blueprint].</p>
      <p><strong>The "Why":</strong> [Placeholder: Core problem this solves â€“ separating stimulus generation logic from driver's DUT interaction logic, enabling reusable stimulus scenarios, managing concurrent transaction streams, and supporting randomization of stimulus, from blueprint].</p>
    </>
  );

  // Level 2: The Practical Explanation
  const level2Content = (
    <>
      <p><strong>Core Mechanics of Sequences:</strong> [Placeholder: Detailed explanation of `uvm_sequence_item` (transactions), `uvm_sequence` (container for items and other sequences). `body()` task. Macros like `uvm_do`, `uvm_do_with`, `uvm_create`, `uvm_send`. Hierarchical sequences (virtual sequences), from blueprint].</p>
      <p><strong>Core Mechanics of Sequencer:</strong> [Placeholder: `uvm_sequencer` base class. `seq_item_export` for driver connection. Arbitration algorithms (e.g., FIFO, weighted). `grab`/`ungrab` mechanism. `get_next_item()`, `item_done()`, `put()` handshake with driver, from blueprint].</p>
