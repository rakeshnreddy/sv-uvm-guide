    <>
      <p><strong>What is it?</strong> [Placeholder: Clear, concise definition of procedural semantics, focusing on always blocks, initial blocks, and the concept of procedural execution in SystemVerilog, from blueprint].</p>
      <p><strong>The Analogy:</strong> [Placeholder: Simple analogy for procedural blocks, e.g., "Think of an 'always' block like a recipe that continuously runs when its ingredients (sensitivity list) change," from blueprint].</p>
      <p><strong>The "Why":</strong> [Placeholder: Core problem procedural semantics solve â€“ modeling behavior over time, reacting to events, creating sequential logic and combinational logic, from blueprint].</p>
    </>
  );

  // Level 2: The Practical Explanation
  const level2Content = (
    <>
      <p><strong>Core Mechanics:</strong> [Placeholder: Detailed explanation of `always`, `always_comb`, `always_ff`, `always_latch`, `initial` blocks. Sensitivity lists. Difference between blocking (`=`) and non-blocking (`&lt;=`) assignments and their implications in different types of always blocks, from blueprint].</p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Code Examples:</h3>
      <CodeBlock
        code={
`// Example of always_ff
logic clk, reset, d_in, q_out;
always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
  if (reset) begin
    q_out <= 1'b0;
  end else begin
    q_out <= d_in;
  end
end

// Example of always_comb
logic a, b, c, y_comb;
always_comb begin
  y_comb = a & b | c;
end

// Example illustrating blocking vs. non-blocking
logic x, y, z;
// Non-blocking
always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
  x <= y;
  y <= x; // y gets old value of x
end

// Blocking
logic reg_a, reg_b, temp_var;
initial begin
  reg_a = 1;
  reg_b = 0;
  temp_var = reg_a;
  reg_a = reg_b;
  reg_b = temp_var;
end`

      <p><strong>Advanced Scenarios & Corner Cases:</strong> [Placeholder: Discussion of race conditions, simulation vs. synthesis differences, common mistakes with blocking/non-blocking, use of `fork-join`, event controls, implications of sensitivity lists (e.g., `*` vs explicit), from blueprint].</p>
      <p><strong>The 10-Year Experience View:</strong> [Placeholder: How a senior engineer debugs issues related to procedural blocks. Rules of thumb for choosing assignment types. Performance considerations. Readability and maintainability of complex procedural code, from blueprint].</p>
      <p><strong>Memory & Retention Tip:</strong> [Placeholder: Specific tip for remembering when to use blocking vs. non-blocking. E.g., &quot;Non-blocking for &apos;always_ff&apos; (state registers), blocking for &apos;always_comb&apos; (temporary variables) and testbench procedural code,&quot; from blueprint].</p>
