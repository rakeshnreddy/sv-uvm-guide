title: 'Nets and Variables: logic vs. wire'
---

Understanding the distinction between nets and variables is crucial in SystemVerilog, as it reflects the underlying hardware concepts of connections versus storage. The introduction of the `logic` data type in SystemVerilog offered a more unified approach compared to traditional Verilog's `wire` and `reg`.

## Theory: Nets vs. Variables

(Reference: IEEE 1800-2017 Standard, Clause 6: Data Types - Nets and Variables)

### Nets

*   **Concept:** Nets represent physical connections between hardware elements, like wires in a circuit. They do not store values themselves but reflect the value of their drivers.
*   **Driving:** A net must be continuously driven by something, such as the output of a primitive (e.g., `and` gate), a continuous `assign` statement, or from a module's port. If a net has no driver, its value is typically high-impedance (`Z`), unless it has a resolution function (e.g., `trireg` for charge storage, or `wand`/`wor` for wired-AND/OR logic).
*   **`wire`:** The most common net type. It's a 4-state data type (`0`, `1`, `X`, `Z`). Other net types include `wand`, `wor`, `tri`, `tri0`, `tri1`, `triand`, `trior`, `trireg`, `supply0`, `supply1`.
*   **Usage:** Primarily for connecting module instances, continuous assignments, and modeling physical wiring.

### Variables

*   **Concept:** Variables store values, similar to variables in software programming languages. They retain their value until explicitly changed by an assignment.
*   **Driving:** Variables are assigned values within procedural blocks (e.g., `initial`, `always`, `always_ff`, `always_comb`, `always_latch`), class methods, or functions/tasks.
*   **`reg` (Verilog legacy):** In traditional Verilog, `reg` was the primary keyword for declaring variables that could be assigned in procedural blocks. It's a 4-state data type. The name `reg` can be misleading, as it doesn't always imply a hardware register (e.g., it could model temporary storage or combinational logic outputs within an `always_comb`).
*   **`logic` (SystemVerilog):** SystemVerilog introduced `logic` as a more versatile 4-state data type.
    *   It can be used just like `reg` for procedural assignments.
    *   Crucially, `logic` can also be continuously assigned, just like a `wire`. This means `logic` can be driven by one continuous assignment or by multiple procedural assignments (though not simultaneously by both in a conflicting manner).
    *   It can also be used for module ports, simplifying declarations.
*   **Other Variable Types:** `integer`, `time`, `real`, `byte`, `shortint`, `int`, `longint`, `bit` are also variable types.

### `logic` vs. `wire`

The key distinction to remember:

*   **`wire`**: Must be continuously driven. Cannot be assigned to in a procedural block (e.g., `always @(posedge clk) wire_signal <= ...;` is illegal).
*   **`logic`**: Can be assigned in procedural blocks. Can ALSO be driven by a single continuous assignment.

Because of its flexibility, `logic` has become the preferred general-purpose 4-state data type in modern SystemVerilog for both RTL design and testbenches.

## Example

This example demonstrates a `wire` being driven by a continuous assignment and `logic` variables being assigned within `always_comb` (for combinational logic) and `always_ff` (for sequential logic) blocks.

```systemverilog
module nets_vs_variables (
  input  logic clk,
  input  logic rst_n,
  input  logic a,
  input  logic b,
  output logic y_comb_logic, // Output driven by logic
  output wire  y_wire        // Output driven by wire
);

  // 'data_bus' is a wire, driven by a continuous assignment
  // It represents a connection.
  wire [7:0] data_bus;
  assign data_bus = {a, b, a, b, a, b, a, b}; // Continuously driven

  // 'y_wire' is an output wire, also driven by a continuous assignment
  assign y_wire = data_bus[0] & data_bus[1];

  // 'temp_logic' is a logic type used as a variable within a procedural block
  logic temp_logic;
  always_comb begin
    temp_logic = a ^ b; // Assigned like a variable
  end

  // 'y_comb_logic' is an output logic, driven by a procedural block
  // It behaves like a variable whose value is determined by the combinational logic.
  always_comb begin
    if (a && b) begin
      y_comb_logic = 1'b1;
    end else begin
      y_comb_logic = temp_logic;
    end
  end

  // 'counter' is a logic type used to model a sequential register
  logic [3:0] counter;
  always_ff @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
    if (!rst_n) begin
      counter <= 4'b0;
    end else begin
      counter <= counter + 1;
    end
  end

  initial begin
    #1 $display("Initial: a=%b, b=%b, data_bus=%h, y_wire=%b, temp_logic=%b, y_comb_logic=%b, counter=%d",
                a, b, data_bus, y_wire, temp_logic, y_comb_logic, counter);
    #100; // Let simulation run for a bit
    $display("After 100ns: a=%b, b=%b, data_bus=%h, y_wire=%b, temp_logic=%b, y_comb_logic=%b, counter=%d",
                a, b, data_bus, y_wire, temp_logic, y_comb_logic, counter);
  end

endmodule
```

## Best Practices

When deciding between `logic` and `wire` (or the older `reg`):

1.  **Prefer `logic` for general use:** For new SystemVerilog code, `logic` is generally the recommended 4-state type for variables and signals unless a specific net type (like `tri` for tri-state buses or `wand` for wired-AND logic) is explicitly needed.
    *   **Verification Academy Recommendation:** Many industry guidelines, including those often cited by resources like Siemens Verification Academy or Doulos, promote using `logic` over `reg`. For example, a common guideline is: *"Use `logic` for all state-holding variables and outputs of procedural blocks. Use `wire` only for signals that require multiple drivers (e.g., unresolved `assign` statements from different modules to the same wire, which is generally poor practice anyway) or specific net types like `tri`."*
2.  **Use `wire` for multiple continuous drivers:** If you need to model situations with multiple continuous drivers (e.g., a tri-state bus where different components can drive the bus), you must use a net type like `wire` or `tri`. A `logic` variable cannot have multiple continuous assignments or procedural drivers driving it simultaneously.
3.  **Clarity of Intent:**
    *   If a signal is purely a connection point and is always driven by a single continuous `assign` statement or by a primitive output, `wire` can still be used to clearly indicate its nature as a connection. However, `logic` would also work here.
    *   If a signal holds state or is assigned within an `always` block, `logic` (or `reg` in older Verilog code) is appropriate.
4.  **Port Declarations:** `logic` can be used for module ports of any direction (`input`, `output`, `inout`). This simplifies port declarations compared to Verilog, where an `output` assigned in a procedural block had to be declared as `output reg`. With SystemVerilog, it's just `output logic`.

By understanding these distinctions and following modern best practices, your SystemVerilog code will be more readable, maintainable, and less prone to errors.
