title: 'The UVM Phases in Detail'
---

The UVM phasing mechanism provides a structured approach to managing the lifecycle of a verification environment. It ensures that components are built, connected, and data is processed in an orderly and synchronized manner. Phases are methods that are automatically called by the UVM framework on all `uvm_component` instances.

(References: Accellera UVM 1.2 User Guide, UVM 1.2 Class Reference, Doulos UVM Golden Reference/Tutorials)

## Overview of Phasing

UVM defines a series of standard phases, grouped into three main categories:

1.  **Build Phases:** These execute top-down in the UVM hierarchy. They are primarily used for constructing and configuring the testbench component hierarchy.
2.  **Run-time Phases:** These execute in parallel (quasi-statically scheduled tasks) after the build phases complete. This is where the actual simulation time passes and stimulus is applied to the DUT.
3.  **Clean-up Phases:** These execute bottom-up in the UVM hierarchy. They are used for extracting information, checking results, and reporting simulation status.

All phase methods are `virtual` functions or tasks within `uvm_component`, allowing derived components to override them and add specific behavior. Each phase method receives a `uvm_phase` object as an argument, which provides context about the current phase and allows for operations like raising/dropping objections.

## Diagram: UVM Phase Execution Order

Here's a simplified textual representation of the main common phases and their execution order:

    end

    %% Note: Run-time phases like pre_reset, reset, etc. execute within or around the run_phase.
    %% For simplicity, they are grouped under run_phase here.
```

*(This Mermaid diagram illustrates the general flow. The `run_phase` itself is a task-based phase, and other task-based "run-time" sub-phases like `reset_phase`, `main_phase`, etc., execute in a specific order if explicitly used and objections are managed.)*

## Detailed Phase Descriptions and Code Snippets

### 1. Build Phases (Function-based, execute top-down)

These phases are used to construct the testbench hierarchy and make connections. They execute in zero simulation time.

#### a. `build_phase(uvm_phase phase)`
*   **Purpose:** The primary phase for constructing child components using the factory (`create()`) and configuring them (e.g., using `uvm_config_db::set()` and `uvm_config_db::get()`).
*   **Execution Order:** Top-down. A parent's `build_phase` completes before its children's `build_phase` methods are called.
```systemverilog
class my_env extends uvm_env;
  `uvm_component_utils(my_env)
  my_agent m_agent; // Child component handle

  function new(string name = "my_env", uvm_component parent = null);
    super.new(name, parent);
  endfunction

  virtual function void build_phase(uvm_phase phase);
    super.build_phase(phase); // Important to call super
    $display("%s: In build_phase", get_full_name());
    // Create child component
    m_agent = my_agent::type_id::create("m_agent", this);
    // Set configuration for child or its descendants
    uvm_config_db#(int)::set(this, "m_agent.m_driver", "num_retries", 3);
  endfunction
endclass
```

#### b. `connect_phase(uvm_phase phase)`
*   **Purpose:** Used to make TLM (Transaction-Level Modeling) connections between components (e.g., connecting a monitor's analysis port to a scoreboard's analysis export). Also used for connecting other types of references between components.
*   **Execution Order:** Top-down.
```systemverilog
class my_agent extends uvm_agent;
  `uvm_component_utils(my_agent)
  my_monitor m_monitor;
  uvm_analysis_port #(my_transaction) ap_to_scoreboard; // Port on the agent

  // ... constructor, build_phase to create m_monitor ...
  function new(string name = "my_agent", uvm_component parent = null);
    super.new(name, parent);
    ap_to_scoreboard = new("ap_to_scoreboard", this);
  endfunction

  virtual function void build_phase(uvm_phase phase);
    super.build_phase(phase);
    m_monitor = my_monitor::type_id::create("m_monitor", this);
  endfunction

  virtual function void connect_phase(uvm_phase phase);
    super.connect_phase(phase);
    $display("%s: In connect_phase", get_full_name());
    if (is_active == UVM_ACTIVE) begin
      // Driver's seq_item_export connected to Sequencer's seq_item_port (often done by uvm_agent)
    end
    // Connect monitor's analysis port to the agent's analysis port
    m_monitor.ap.connect(this.ap_to_scoreboard);
  endfunction
endclass
```

#### c. `end_of_elaboration_phase(uvm_phase phase)`
*   **Purpose:** The last chance to make any final adjustments to the component hierarchy or configuration before simulation starts. Useful for displaying topology information or performing checks that require the entire hierarchy to be built and connected.
*   **Execution Order:** Top-down.
```systemverilog
class my_scoreboard extends uvm_scoreboard;
  `uvm_component_utils(my_scoreboard)
  // ... constructor ...
  function new(string name = "my_scoreboard", uvm_component parent = null);
    super.new(name, parent);
  endfunction

  virtual function void end_of_elaboration_phase(uvm_phase phase);
    super.end_of_elaboration_phase(phase);
    $display("%s: In end_of_elaboration_phase. Testbench construction complete.", get_full_name());
    // Example: Print configuration or check for expected connections
  endfunction
endclass
```

#### d. `start_of_simulation_phase(uvm_phase phase)`
*   **Purpose:** Called just before time-consuming simulation phases begin. Used for tasks like initializing component state that depends on the final elaborated design, displaying banner information, or setting up debug features.
*   **Execution Order:** Top-down.
```systemverilog
class base_test extends uvm_test;
  `uvm_component_utils(base_test)
  // ... constructor ...
  function new(string name = "base_test", uvm_component parent = null);
    super.new(name, parent);
  endfunction

  virtual function void start_of_simulation_phase(uvm_phase phase);
    super.start_of_simulation_phase(phase);
    $display("=====================================================");
    $display("Starting Test: %s", get_type_name());
    $display("UVM Seed: %0d", uvm_pkg::uvm_get_to_pkg_scope().get_uvm_seeder().get_seed());
    $display("=====================================================");
    // Set a drain time for the run_phase if not using specific run-time sub-phases
    phase.phase_done.set_drain_time(this, 200ns);
  endfunction
endclass
```

### 2. Run-Time Phases (Task-based, execute in parallel)

These phases are where simulation time advances. They are task-based, allowing them to consume simulation time. The `run_phase` is the main one, but UVM provides a set of predefined run-time phases that execute in sequence if used.

#### `run_phase(uvm_phase phase)`
*   **Purpose:** The primary phase for stimulus generation, driving DUT signals, monitoring DUT activity, and checking behavior. This phase (and other run-time task phases) proceeds only if objections are raised. When all objections are dropped, the phase ends.
*   **Execution Order:** All components' `run_phase` tasks start effectively in parallel. Their execution is coordinated by stimulus generation (sequences) and UVM's objection mechanism.
```systemverilog
class my_driver extends uvm_driver #(my_transaction);
  // ... utils, new ...
  `uvm_component_utils(my_driver)
  function new(string name = "my_driver", uvm_component parent = null);
    super.new(name,parent);
  endfunction

  virtual task run_phase(uvm_phase phase);
    // Raise an objection to keep the phase running while this driver is active
    // phase.raise_objection(this, "Driver is active");
    // No explicit objection needed here if sequence raises it

    forever begin
      my_transaction tr;
      seq_item_port.get_next_item(tr); // Get transaction from sequencer
      $display("[%0t] %s: Received transaction: %s", $time, get_full_name(), tr.convert2string());
      // Actual signal driving logic would be here
      # (tr.delay)ns; // Consume time based on transaction
      $display("[%0t] %s: Finished driving transaction", $time, get_full_name());
      seq_item_port.item_done();
    end
    // phase.drop_objection(this, "Driver finished its work");
  endtask
endclass

// In a sequence:
class my_sequence extends uvm_sequence #(my_transaction);
  // ... utils, new ...
  `uvm_object_utils(my_sequence)
  function new(string name="my_sequence");
    super.new(name);
  endfunction

  virtual task body();
    // Raise objection at the start of the sequence if it's controlling the test duration
    if (starting_phase != null) starting_phase.raise_objection(this, "Sequence started");

    // Create and send transactions
    repeat(5) begin
      my_transaction tr = my_transaction::type_id::create("tr");
      start_item(tr);
      assert(tr.randomize());
      // tr.delay = $urandom_range(5, 20);
      finish_item(tr);
      #1ns; // Small delay between transactions
    end

    if (starting_phase != null) starting_phase.drop_objection(this, "Sequence completed");
  endtask
endclass
```
*   **Other Run-Time Phases:** UVM also defines finer-grained run-time phases like `pre_reset_phase`, `reset_phase`, `post_reset_phase`, `pre_configure_phase`, `configure_phase`, `post_configure_phase`, `pre_main_phase`, `main_phase`, `post_main_phase`, `pre_shutdown_phase`, `shutdown_phase`, `post_shutdown_phase`. These allow for more structured control over different stages of a test (e.g., applying resets, configuring DUT registers, running main stimulus). They execute in a specific order if objections are raised for them. If these are used, the main `run_phase` typically might not be directly used, or it runs in parallel with them.

### 3. Clean-up Phases (Function-based, execute bottom-up)

These phases run after all time-consuming run phases have completed. They are used to collect final results, perform checks, and generate reports.

#### a. `extract_phase(uvm_phase phase)`
*   **Purpose:** Used to extract data from various parts of the testbench (e.g., scoreboard, coverage collectors, monitors) for final processing and checking.
*   **Execution Order:** Bottom-up. A child's `extract_phase` completes before its parent's.
```systemverilog
class my_scoreboard extends uvm_scoreboard;
  // ... utils, new, write method ...
  `uvm_component_utils(my_scoreboard)
  function new(string name = "my_scoreboard", uvm_component parent=null);
    super.new(name,parent);
  endfunction

  int actual_packets_received = 0;
  // write method called by monitor to push transactions

  virtual function void extract_phase(uvm_phase phase);
    super.extract_phase(phase);
    $display("%s: In extract_phase. Total packets received: %0d", get_full_name(), actual_packets_received);
    // Further processing of collected data can happen here
  endfunction
endclass
```

#### b. `check_phase(uvm_phase phase)`
*   **Purpose:** Used to perform final checks on the extracted data to determine if the test passed or failed. For example, comparing expected results with actual results.
*   **Execution Order:** Bottom-up.
```systemverilog
// Continuing my_scoreboard from above
  int expected_packets = 100; // This might be set by config_db or test

  virtual function void check_phase(uvm_phase phase);
    super.check_phase(phase);
    $display("%s: In check_phase.", get_full_name());
    if (actual_packets_received == expected_packets) begin
      `uvm_info("SCOREBOARD_PASS", $sformatf("All %0d packets received correctly.", expected_packets), UVM_LOW)
    end else begin
      `uvm_error("SCOREBOARD_FAIL", $sformatf("Mismatch! Expected %0d packets, got %0d.", expected_packets, actual_packets_received))
    end
  endfunction
```

#### c. `report_phase(uvm_phase phase)`
*   **Purpose:** Used to generate and display final simulation reports, summaries of test results, coverage information, etc.
*   **Execution Order:** Bottom-up.
```systemverilog
// Continuing my_scoreboard from above
  virtual function void report_phase(uvm_phase phase);
    super.report_phase(phase);
    `uvm_info(get_full_name(), $sformatf("Final Report: Processed %0d packets. Expected %0d.", actual_packets_received, expected_packets), UVM_NONE)
    // UVM automatically calls uvm_report_object.report_summaries() at the end of this phase
  endfunction
endclass
```

#### d. `final_phase(uvm_phase phase)`
*   **Purpose:** The very last phase. Used for any final cleanup actions, closing files, or terminating external processes.
*   **Execution Order:** Top-down. (Note: This is an exception to the bottom-up nature of other cleanup phases).
```systemverilog
class base_test extends uvm_test;
  // ... utils, new ...
  `uvm_component_utils(base_test)
  function new(string name = "base_test", uvm_component parent=null);
    super.new(name,parent);
  endfunction

  virtual function void final_phase(uvm_phase phase);
    super.final_phase(phase);
    $display("=====================================================");
    $display("Test %s finished. Simulation Time: %0t ns", get_type_name(), $time);
    $display("UVM Verbosity Level: %s", uvm_root::get().get_report_verbosity_level_hier() );
    $display("=====================================================");
    // Any final actions like closing log files
  endfunction
endclass
```

Understanding and correctly utilizing these phases is key to building robust, reusable, and maintainable UVM verification environments. Each phase provides a specific context and timing for different testbench operations.
