    <>
      <p><strong>What is it?</strong> [Placeholder: Clear definition of functional coverage as a metric to measure how well the design&apos;s functionality has been exercised by the testbench, as defined by a verification plan, from blueprint].</p>
      <p><strong>The Analogy:</strong> [Placeholder: Analogy for functional coverage, e.g., &quot;Think of functional coverage like a checklist for a pilot before takeoff; it ensures all critical functions and scenarios have been tested, not just that the plane moved,&quot; from blueprint].</p>
      <p><strong>The &quot;Why&quot;:</strong> [Placeholder: Core problem functional coverage solves â€“ providing confidence that the design has been thoroughly verified against its specification, identifying untested areas, guiding test writing, and determining verification completeness, from blueprint].</p>
    </>

  // Level 2: The Practical Explanation
  const level2Content = (
    <>
      <p><strong>Core Mechanics:</strong> [Placeholder: Detailed explanation of `covergroup`, `coverpoint` for signals/variables, `bins` (explicit, auto, illegal, ignore), `cross` coverage for interactions between coverpoints. `iff` and `with` clauses. Sampling events. Built-in methods like `sample()`, `get_coverage()`, from blueprint].</p>
