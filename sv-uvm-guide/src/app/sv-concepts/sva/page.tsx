    <>
      <p><strong>What is it?</strong> [Placeholder: Clear definition of SystemVerilog Assertions as properties that specify design behavior over time, used for functional checking, from blueprint].</p>
      <p><strong>The Analogy:</strong> [Placeholder: Analogy for SVA, e.g., &quot;Think of assertions like traffic rules for your design&apos;s signals; they define what should or shouldn&apos;t happen at specific times or sequences,&quot; from blueprint].</p>
      <p><strong>The &quot;Why&quot;:</strong> [Placeholder: Core problem SVA solves â€“ formally specifying and automatically checking design intent, improving bug detection, providing functional coverage points, from blueprint].</p>
    </>

  // Level 2: The Practical Explanation
  const level2Content = (
    <>
      <p><strong>Core Mechanics:</strong> [Placeholder: Detailed explanation of sequences, properties, boolean expressions, temporal operators (`##`, `|->` which is implies, `|=>` which is eventually implies, etc.), assertion directives (`assert`, `assume`, `cover`), immediate vs. concurrent assertions, clocking context, from blueprint].</p>

`// Example of a simple sequence and property
sequence s_req_ack;
  req ##1 ack; // Simplified: req followed by ack 1 cycle later
endsequence

endproperty

// Example of an immediate assertion

end

// Example of a cover directive
cover_req_ack_scenario: cover property (@(posedge clk) req ##1 ack);`

      <p><strong>Advanced Scenarios & Corner Cases:</strong> [Placeholder: Discussion of multi-clock assertions, local variables in properties, `disable iff`, `throughout`, sequence repetition, binding assertions to modules/interfaces, assertion coverage, formal verification basics with SVA, from blueprint].</p>
      <p><strong>The 10-Year Experience View:</strong> [Placeholder: Senior engineer&apos;s approach to writing effective and maintainable assertions. How SVA fits into a larger verification strategy. Common pitfalls and debugging SVA failures. Performance impact of assertions in simulation, from blueprint].</p>
